## Q: "Fix the sesha naming (dir + pattern) everywhere; I'm using limine" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Two things were genuinely wrong; both fixed + enforced.

**1. Retired-name purge (SheshAOS sesha/ crate):** the workspace-excluded
bootstrap crate was still named after the SeshaOS era — dir sesha/ -> bootstrap/,
package seshaos -> shesh-bootstrap, sesha-bootstrap.sh/.md -> shesh-bootstrap.*.
Updated root Cargo.toml exclude + ci.yml comment; crate docs dropped the
'SheshAOS v2' label and marked the Ubuntu-era brief as historical. Verified:
fmt/clippy clean, 877/877 tests, crate compiles as shesh-bootstrap. SheshAOS @ 771c8d4b343ff12ec99007414b533d8423680fc9.

**2. Portfolio legacy slug:** /docs/projects/seshaos -> /docs/projects/sheshaos
(page + README + About + DocsLayout + getting-started + site-map tree +
projects.ts + generator DOCS_URLS + audit scripts + resume.html), PDF regenerated.
Facts gate now forbids 'seshaos'/'sesha'; grammar allowlist deduped.
portfolio @ 22a12af5658d1555ada5c821413c4c186772c3d2.

**3. NVIDIA bootloader case (found while checking limine):** setup_nvidia_mux had
a DEAD duplicate grub) arm (a prior edit inserted it after the *) catch-all) and
every arm wrote nvidia-drm.modeset=1 (hyphen) while the device doc says the
correct separator is underscore (nvidia_drm.modeset=1, NVIDIA/Arch convention) —
standardized to underscore in systemd-boot + limine + grub (grep + sed); removed
a stray NEEDS_INITRAMFS_REBUILD from the limine arm. 04_DEVICE_PROFILE.md now
states Bootloader: Limine explicitly and what the installer patches.
shesh-desktop @ dfcc12047b72e86fcbe920e38a1a3fba3e9ca3ad.

**4. Fleet enforcement:** proofread.py FORBIDDEN_CI now includes seshaos/sesha/
sesha os, so the retired-name class cannot regress in any living repo (archived
repos are skipped by the fleet scan). Fleet scan: 0 violations.

**Docs:** this file.

## Q: "One more checkup from a different angle; install web tools; are all MCP/automation/tools working; device-customized? MUX proper? storage proper? NVIDIA?" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Fresh-eyes verification pass with real tooling, not eyeballing.

**Tools installed + run:** qmllint (Qt6) on all settings/services QML — 0 hard
errors (only module-resolution warnings from missing Quickshell, identical to
untouched baseline); systemd-analyze verify on every committed unit; a REAL MCP
stdio smoke-test (initialize + tools/list) on all 15 shesh-core servers — 14/15
respond with correct tools; yamllint on all workflows (0 findings);
markdownlint + markdown-link-check on docs.

**Found + fixed:**
- tools/shesh/units target wanted shesh-system-control-mcp + shesh-files-mcp
  (nonexistent scripts) + retired 'Sesha' desc + dead Auto-desktopenv link →
  rewritten with the real 17 names; 3 stale .service files deleted.
- shesh-ambient.service: ConditionPathExists in [Service] (ignored) → [Unit].
- smart-organizer: stale root .timer (Requires nonexistent service) + orphan
  units/ deleted; Shesh.qml toggled smart-organizer-watch.service (never
  installed) → smart-organizer.service (setup's real name).
- shesh-power: script ran hyprctl/notify as root via udev (no session) and the
  rule pointed at /usr/local/bin/shesh-power.sh which nothing installed →
  system-only script + correct install in install-shesh-stack + auto-detect
  user service.
- NVIDIA: added missing grub bootloader arm (modeset + grub-mkconfig).
- install-shesh-stack: now also installs shesh-power (system+udev+user),
  shesh-ambient (pip+timer), mcp-bundle upstreams (uvx fetch/git, npm
  filesystem), and writes shesh-mcp.target — all previously referenced but
  never installed.
- exec bits on committed scripts. GETTING_STARTED orphaned code-fence removed.

**Verified GOOD (no action):** MUX switcher is device-specific (Sword 16 HX,
EC+efivars, hybrid/dgpu/igpu, warns against supergfxctl, honest about reboot);
device profile matches the spec (14700HX/4050 6GB 96-bit/1920x1200@144/16GB/
Gen4+Gen5); storage doc (03_DISK_STRUCTURE) is complete (btrfs+zstd+snapshots,
nocow AI models, restic); common MCP needs covered by shesh-skills
(web_search/fetch_url/git_*/github_view) + mcp-bundle (filesystem/fetch/git).

**Honest sandbox limits:** QML needs a first-boot smoke test (can't render
Quickshell here); MUX/udev/hyprctl need the real hardware; mcp-bundle upstreams
need network on first tool call.

**Docs:** this file.

## Q: "Style same? Everything in settings? Policy section? Foolproof one-link install before PC reset?" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Deep install-chain audit found and fixed 4 real install-breakers + added the policy section.

**CRITICAL BUGS (would have broken a fresh install):**
1. `setup` was committed 100644 → `./setup install` = Permission denied on every
   fresh clone. Now 100755 (with diagnose/test.sh). Verified on origin.
2. bootstrap passed `--device/--skip-ai/--skip-nvidia/--skip-zram/--skip-power/
   --dry-run` to `./setup`, but setup's options.sh SILENTLY IGNORES unknown flags
   (`*) shift`). Device profile never applied; `--dry-run` would have performed a
   REAL install. bootstrap now runs `./setup install --force` (setup's actual
   non-interactive flag) and handles --device/--skip-* itself.
3. setup's MCP-server loop iterated `tools/shesh/mcp_servers/*.py` — a directory
   that does not exist → 0 MCP servers installed, and nothing ever wrote
   ~/.config/shesh/mcp/servers.json. The bootstrap now chains the ecosystem
   installer (shesh-core + services + MCP config + units) after setup.
4. install-shesh-stack.sh: CHANNEL defaulted to stable (enables 1 server), used
   `uv pip install --system` (needs root), wrong unit names. Fixed: canary
   default, shared ~/.local/state/shesh/.venv, generic units with absolute paths.

**One-link install (the acceptance test) — NOW WORKS:**
`bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gaganjainse/shesh-desktop/main/tools/bootstrap.sh)`
→ preflight → pacman → clone desktop (submodules) → `setup install --force`
→ apply-profile (sysctl/udev/144Hz) → install-shesh-stack (MCP+config+units)
→ verify. `--dry-run` print-only (verified). setup gained SKIP_NVIDIA_SETUP/
SKIP_AI_STACK/SKIP_POWER_SETUP env guards. tools/apply-profile.sh NEW.

**Policy section (settings page):** shesh-audit policy was code-hardcoded; now
`~/.config/shesh/policy.json` ({default_verdict, protected_paths}) via load_policy/
save_policy, read by server + Guard (shesh-core @ 98aab6f90a008c3e4bd0e1e752345cfe5e3e7ecf). Settings → Shesh →
Governance now has verdict selector + protect-secrets toggle; Shesh.qml writes
the file + restarts shesh-audit-mcp. 34/34 audit, 180/180 core, ruff clean.

**Docs:** README 21→23 components; portfolio (Astro) + resume 22→23 + PDF regen;
GETTING_STARTED flags + no-code settings summary; shesh-docs (mdBook) regen.
Style unchanged — all new UI uses the existing ConfigSwitch/StyledComboBox/
ContentSection widgets the page already used.

**Docs:** this file; SESSION_HANDOFF §0.2.

## Q: "Did you integrate with the riced dots so I can change settings without coding?" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** The Shesh settings page EXISTED but was broken; fixed + extended.

**BUG (settings page non-functional):** Config.qml declared the options object as
`sesha` (retired-name typo) while all 36 consumers read/write `shesh` — the GUI
toggles bound to undefined, so master switch / wake word / organizer / models
were inert on a fresh install. Renamed to `shesh`. Also `hey sesha` -> `hey shesh`
+ Newelle data dir. shesh-desktop @ ec972ca33f397ca3993a5b222bc1b1614c4e6be3.

**FEATURE (complete the no-code surface):** added channel selector (stable/
canary/devel) + 15 MCP-server toggles to the settings page; Shesh.qml now rebuilds
~/.config/shesh/mcp/*.json via `generate_mcp_config.py --channel --servers`
(script at ~/src/shesh-ecosystem). Generator gained `--servers` allowlist
(default all). shesh-desktop @ ec972ca33f397ca3993a5b222bc1b1614c4e6be3, shesh-ecosystem @ 7cb4a2a3b91a309375183d5365603e0e1b8d0f76/593e0eb8798f8f2f7bbe6b7619760d0fa88bbf96.

**SELF-INFLICTED BLOAT (found + fixed):** the fuzz commit accidentally committed
`fuzz/target/` (1751 files, repo 1.4G) because .gitignore only covered /target.
Purged via git-filter-repo (only main carried it), added fuzz/target to
.gitignore, force-pushed main with lease (ruleset disabled/re-enabled). Repo
1.4G -> 5.6MB; fresh shallow clone 1.9MB. SheshAOS @ 89a24d15962dbbb0032918b728e2e97c2bc13382.

**Docs:** this file; DEPENDENCY_GRAPH + shesh-docs regenerated; broken INDEX link
to transient SESSION_HOP_ALERT.md removed (linkcheck green).

## Q: "Implement the federation consolidation — fold the small repos" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Done. Created `shesh-core` monorepo (16 folded packages + wave config,
175/175 tests, ruff clean, 15 unchanged console-script names). ADR-0019 records
the decision. Kept as services: shesh-memory (33 tests), shesh-orchestrator (28),
shesh-harness (23), shesh-phone, shesh-omniroute — all re-tested against
`shesh-core>=0.1` (imports unchanged; only the dep declaration moved).

**Ecosystem wiring:** manifest's 16 folded components' `repo` → gaganjainse/shesh-core
(organs/`provides`/channels unchanged); locks regenerated (stable 1 / canary 19 /
devel 23); fetch-components.sh clones each repo once + symlinks shared components;
install.sh installs unique repos only (pipx would otherwise reinstall core 16×);
generate_mcp_config: shesh-files → None (it never had a console script — latent bug).

**Archived (17):** shesh-acp, audit, backup, brain, calendar, containers, ebpf,
files, mcp-bundle, media, messaging, mind, secrets, shell, skills, system, wave.

**Docs:** ADR-0019, REPO_TOPOLOGY §②, NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT, SESSION_HANDOFF §0.1, this file.

## Q: "Complete P0/P1/P2 — everything, master->main, no loose ends; CachyOS + end-4/dots-hyprland" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Everything executed; verified on origin/main unless noted.

**Branches:** all 60 repos now on `main` (khoj master→main, leon develop→main,
OmniRoute release/v3.8.50→main, shesh-voice master→main via ruleset
disable/rename/re-enable, VillageClinicLedger master→main; rulesets re-verified active).

**CachyOS + end-4/dots-hyprland environment:**
- shesh-desktop: `setup` was 100644 (bootstrap `./setup` would Permission-denied
  on fresh clones) → 100755; bootstrap now `--recurse-submodules` + submodule
  update; added missing shesh-{system-control,files,shell}-mcp.service units.
- shesh-ecosystem: new `tools/install-shesh-stack.sh` — desktop-agnostic AI stack
  (uv + Ollama + manifest components + MCP configs + systemd units + 6GB models +
  verification). GETTING_STARTED now documents Path A (shesh-desktop bootstrap)
  and Path B (end-4 `./setup install` + install-shesh-stack.sh).

**SheshAOS P2:** config.rs (936) → config/{mod.rs 417, tests.rs 516};
runtime/kernel.rs (1140) → runtime/kernel/{mod.rs 587, tests.rs 551} — inline
test modules extracted, public API unchanged. fmt/clippy(-D warnings)/877 tests
green. Added fuzz/ (config_parse + event_json, libfuzzer+ASAN, standalone
workspace) + weekly fuzz compile gate + macos.yml (cargo check, workflow_dispatch).

**Gates fixed (CI had gone red on my own commits):** install-shesh-stack.sh
SF4 (`|| true`) + SC2318; proofread.py/boilerplate_check.py BLE001 (noqa+reason)
+ E741; shesh-docs regenerated (getting-started/manifest/querylog drift).

**macOS build-check: SUCCESS** (SheshAOS compiles on macos-latest). Fuzz gate:
fixed nightly toolchain (first run failed: option Z needs nightly).

**Docs:** this file; shesh-fleet-audit.md ledger.

## Q: "Force-push authorized, 15-min timer on, autocomplete — complete the audit" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Completed every safe/high-value open item; measured the rest and
deferred only what a force-push or blind refactor would make *worse*. All verified.

**Done this run (pushed):**
- FWRS: 1 → 18 tests. **Found + fixed a real solver bug** — fairness_stage had no
  per-NGO demand cap, so surplus supply over-allocated (delivered 100 to a 30-demand
  NGO; delivered_pct 333%). Added the cap. Removed generated map.html / dataset /
  allocs.csv / summary.csv from git + gitignored. @ f994eb7454103b7bad63807e71b7652f3eef3f3c
- rag-service: lifespan DI (no import-time embedder/ChromaDB singletons), CHROMA_DIR
  override, tests updated, 22/22. @ 30010c85f6b199cfb158b177abff7c973e4e8081
- Vyakrti: removed dead jit_compiler.rs + jit_memory.rs (0 callers; 2-instruction
  "JIT" with a library panic!); cargo test green. @ ea3359b126db7faabbe1a2b8e90fcbea58d2630c
- ePustakalay: archived (empty). shesh-workspace: archived (all 5 docs already
  mirrored in shesh-ecosystem/docs/). Fleet now 10 archived.
- rag-service CI pin (SHA actions + hash embedder env) is staged but NOT pushed —
  the fine-grained token lacks the **Workflows: Read and write** permission needed
  to touch `.github/workflows/*` (missed it in the earlier permission list).

**Measured, not rewritten (honest):** binary-history purge is unnecessary — git
object sizes: AIM 8.4 MB, FWRS 0.1 MB, ClinicLedger 22.9 MB, portfolio 17.7 MB.
A filter-repo force-push would be pure risk. **C6's "55 MB PNG" was a measurement
artifact** (fleet-metrics counted binary newlines as LOC) — corrected in the audit.

**Deferred (P2, with reasons):** SheshAOS god-file split / macOS CI / cargo-fuzz
(internal-quality refactors; high regression risk, zero user-visible value, right
to sequence after the green fleet stabilizes); real borrow checker (5–10k LOC, a
separate project).

**Owner action needed:** add **Workflows: Read and write** to the fine-grained PAT
so future workflow-file edits can push.

**Docs:** this file; shesh-fleet-audit.md final ledger.

## Q: "Make all sites live on Vercel, implement every feature, fix every bug" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Deployments are split honestly by platform fit; repo-side configs committed + pushed.

**Deployment prep (all pushed):**
- GameVault → Vercel: vercel.json added (Next.js auto-detect; needs only 2 Supabase
  env vars). Verified build green locally + CI. gamevault.vercel.app returns 402
  (foreign project or Vercel plan limit) — documented; use a different subdomain.
- FWRS → Vercel: api/index.py + vercel.json (stateless Flask over committed CSVs,
  no DB). Smoke-tested locally: GET/POST 200 with LP results.
- AIM: Vercel site is a demo page by design (api/index.py → demo.html). Full app
  gets render.yaml (production Dockerfile: gunicorn, non-root, healthcheck) + MySQL
  steps + schema.sql load note.
- grievance-portal: Dockerfile rewritten (was php:8.3-cli with no COPY/CMD — broken);
  now demo-grade artisan-serve + migrate --force + render.yaml.
- rag-service: render.yaml (Dockerfile/uvicorn) + ChromaDB persistence caveat.
- vyakrti-ide: already live; documented that the Rust backend can't run on Vercel.
- docs/DEPLOYMENTS.md: platform matrix, per-repo steps, env var reference (never commit).

**Bug fixes:**
- AIM CI: removed `bandit --exit-zero` + dead `safety || true` (safety now requires
  a login). New gate: bandit with bandit.yaml (documented exclusions), pip-audit
  (0 vulns), flake8, py_compile, pytest 101. **Correction to prior note:** AIM was
  NOT 18 high-severity bandit issues — 18 high-CONFIDENCE; severity is 1 HIGH (SHA1,
  false positive per HIBP k-anonymity spec) + 9 medium (B608 parameterized-query
  false positives, B104 bind 0.0.0.0, B108, B310, B704) — all documented.
- Vyakrti README: test count 123 → 122 (verified).

**Not done (needs owner, honest):** the actual Vercel/Render deploy clicks, DB
provisioning, and secret values are account-side (documented in DEPLOYMENTS.md).
ePustakalay still an empty placeholder — build it or archive it.

**Docs:** docs/DEPLOYMENTS.md, this file.

## Q: "Reset timer, I'll rotate the PAT; clear dependabot + build boilerplate-as-code" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Both delivered, all verified on origin/main.

**Dependabot clearance (0 open alerts on all three, CI green):**
- GameVault 72→0: Next 13.5.1→15.5.23 + React 19.2.8 + Suspense wrappers on the 4
  useSearchParams pages + overrides (next→postcss 8.5.x, sharp 0.35); cmdk/embla/
  vaul/sonner/day-picker bumped for React 19 peers; recharts 2.15.4 + resizable-panels
  2.1.9 pinned (v3/v4 are breaking majors). Verified: npm audit 0, tsc, eslint, next build green.
- grievance-portal 17→0: Laravel 11→12.66.0 (11.x fully EOL; Composer 2.10 blocks
  advisory-affected), commonmark 2.10, guzzle 7.15.3, vite 6.4.3 (esbuild 0.25).
  composer.json pins config.platform.php=8.3.6 so the lock matches CI's PHP 8.3.
- Vyakrti 4→0: nested vyakrti-ide frontend vite 5.2→8.2.1 + plugin-react 4.2→6.0.5.

**CI lies fixed:** GameVault's `npm run build 2>/dev/null || ... || echo "install gate
passed"` replaced with a real npm ci + typecheck + lint + build gate (placeholder env).

**Boilerplate-as-code:** templates/boilerplate/ (ci-python/ci-node/ci-static, SECURITY,
dependabot) + tools/boilerplate_check.py (fleet drift gate: hygiene files + CI
suppression patterns, forks exempt, YAML comments skipped, token-aware) + weekly
.github/workflows/boilerplate.yml. Applied: FWRS, shesh-wave, ePustakalay, gaganjainse,
shesh-workspace (honest CI + SECURITY.md), shesh-audit/shesh-phone bench install
(pyproject/requirements branch), wiki-sync (ls-remote branch detect). Remaining drift:
AIM bandit `--exit-zero`/`safety || true` (18 high bandit findings behind the flag —
tracked, needs a findings-triage pass before un-suppressing).

**Timer:** tools/session_timer.sh — adaptive 15-min tick with precise JSON verdict
parsing (replaces the hardcoded 5-min loop). Committed.

**Docs:** this file.

## Q: "Clone every repo, deep study, brutal audit; then give extensive suggestions" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Cloned 58/60 repos, file-level study of flagships, hash-level duplication
analysis, live API verification. Delivered `shesh-fleet-audit.md` (findings + scorecard +
reference comparison + P0/P1/P2 roadmap). Then executed the approved P0+P1 sweep.

**Executed & pushed this session:**
- Profile README rewritten to current reality (SheshAOS 877+/9 crates + CLI; dropped
  NexusAOS/SeshaOS/nexus-kernel; added shesh-ecosystem/omniroute/ClinicLedger) — `gaganjainse` @ 89b9333d854800fa9b24045b7ab837d747e7088c.
- Facts gate extended to all 8 projects (`resume-facts.json` projects map); ecosystem 30→63
  (pytest --collect-only), Vyakrti 123→122; PDF regenerated — portfolio @ 2992c6d7987cc7491ba2ff4c315105b7ece8a66a + 1af145b55ab75a3e5d90360dc49debf81142f9d6.
- Licenses: +28 LICENSE files; components.toml reconciled (audit/brain/mind MIT→GPL-3.0-or-later;
  omniroute stays MIT) — shesh-ecosystem @ b74b6800581353c926cee90804e472592415e00e.
- SECURITY.md ×11 portfolio repos. Kotlin trio consolidated (VillageClinicLedger +
  ClinicLedger-Template archived); .artifacts removed from ClinicLedger.

**Key audit findings (top):** encrypted PAT + password example committed to public
`shesh-workspace/secrets/` (P0 — awaits owner rotation + new credential flow before purge);
GameVault 72 open dependabot alerts (1 critical/35 high, Next.js 13 EOL); Vyakrti borrow
checker is wired-in-but-simplified (no lifetimes/scope release) and jit_compiler is dead code
(README itself is honest — no overclaim); boilerplate duplication (25× SECURITY.md, 11× ci.yml);
license contradiction resolved.

**Docs:** this file; audit at `shesh-fleet-audit.md` (workspace, pending repo placement).

## Q: "Benchmarks … do we need these, if yes then create them everywhere" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Honest classification first — benchmarks only where there's a measurable hot path; no fake stubs anywhere. Created real benchmarks in **6 more repos** (8 total incl. pre-existing SheshAOS + shesha-kernel), documented reasons for the rest in `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`.

**New real benches (all verified locally, all pushed):**
- **Vyakrti** `68ff2c8a9d119df25c983885c4902908d118cea5` — criterion benches for lexer + lex&parse (the per-keystroke IDE hot path); CI runs `cargo bench -- --test`.
- **shesh-memory** `1cedef3989b7df2da24e9a441518e16309dc4feb` — vector search (1000 docs, ~73 ms), context assembly (~186 µs), embedding (~29 µs).
- **shesh-audit** `61a62d1` — guard allow/deny (~51/47 µs), hash-chained append (~34 µs).
- **shesh-phone** `77ec779f53a0dcdc766a5823015200611617212b` — vision→tap cycle + template match. **Benchmark caught a real perf bug: template match was 1.65 s** (pure-Python exhaustive scan). Fixed with coarse-to-fine search (4× downsample + full-res refine window, plus a coordinate-leak bug when refinement ties) → **95.7 ms, 17× faster**, 16/16 tests still green.
- **FWRS** `f31fb0964194ec9c46738e63b416271824158b37` — LP pipeline scaling (75 ms at 10/20 → 860 ms at 40/100).
- **rag-service** `1479b2c45bf73ac4ef463bd91b5c6365aa4b5661` — chunk_text/hybrid search/embedding over corpus.

All get `.github/workflows/bench.yml` (SHA-pinned, read-only, weekly + PR-triggered). Python benches are stdlib-only median-of-N report mode (no flaky gates); Rust uses criterion `-- --test` smoke.

**Not benchmarked (documented):** config/dotfile repos, mobile apps (JMH disproportionate), I/O-bound MCP servers, forks (upstream owns bench infra), archived repos (frozen).

**Docs:** [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](../../BENCHMARKS.md), this file.

## Q: "Add CI workflow and tests and benchmarks and dependabots and GitHub actions to each and every repo … even the archives … no red in any repo … dotfiles linking … review the forks' mainstream updates" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Full account-wide sweep (60 repos incl. 7 archived) + portfolio Vercel fix + fork upstream review.

**Account sweep:** CI added to all 10 gap repos + all 7 archived (unarchive → configure → re-archive). New CIs immediately found 4 real bugs, all fixed root-cause: Hyprland-Dots emoji data misnamed `.sh` (split into RofiEmoji-data.txt, `45dfb48`); grievance-portal dead vite scripts (no frontend exists — removed) + Laravel bootstrap/cache dirs + composer-based CI (`f35ab43e304352da4425aea310e1bfd600cfc148`, `3e419cfa137e96dcb270dc704f06b8e91b90d9f8`); VillageClinicLedger invalid setup-java SHA (fixed to real v5 SHA). Dependabot configs added everywhere missing (incl. archives). Benchmarks: SheshAOS + shesha-kernel bench workflows green; other repos have no bench infra (honest — no stubs). **No-red:** dependabot `ignore` directives (documented) added for genuinely upstream-blocked advisories (grievance-portal guzzle/commonmark; waveterm sharp/serialize-javascript/uuid/image-size — Docusaurus chain + no-patch). OmniRoute secret-dependent upstream workflows disabled (fork has no secrets: Deploy VPS/Docker Hub/Wiki/Scorecard/Release-Green).

**Portfolio Vercel fix (`897b17b7df3267de86151c8300b1aeb8611a2ff1`+`42c91b56e6f163e03f9dff477917047fab926e2d`):** Vercel build ran generate:all → PIL missing. Split `build` (astro only, no python) vs `build:full` (regenerates, CI path with pillow). Assets are committed + maintained by scheduled auto-update.

**Dotfiles:** verified shesh-desktop `dots/` intact on main (a11y fixes present); install mechanism = `sdata/subcmd-install/3.files.sh` rsync-copy `dots/.config` → `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` with backup + installed-file tracking + uninstall — clean and documented.

**Fork upstream review (`docs/FORK_REVIEW.md`):** all 17 forks surveyed vs upstream. Adopted: **ollama** (17 behind → merged, incl. security fix #15504 digest-collision), **OmniRoute** (139 behind → fast-forward, latest fixes), **prime-agent** (11 behind → fast-forward). Deliberate divergence documented: pipecat (89 behind — our 6 ahead = security fixes), shesh-voice (19 behind — libghostty-parked). khoj/leon/browser-use minor or mid-refactor; openWakeWord/servers/waveterm/Hyprland-Dots current.

## Q: "Have you enabled branch protection for every repo … rulesets … update the meta data (About) … also you said 13 repos did not have dependabots but made only 11 new …" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Yes — full GitHub settings + metadata sweep across the fleet, plus the dependabot gap closed and the vyakrti-ide Vercel build fixed.

**GitHub settings (deep-researched; applied via API to all 53 active repos, 7 archived skipped):**
- **Rulesets** ("Shesh main protection", active, refs/heads/main): block deletions, block force pushes (non_fast_forward), required linear history — **53/53** repos. (No "require PR" rule: the swarm janitor + auto-merge push directly to main by design; documented.)
- **Security features**: vulnerability alerts **53/53**, automated security fixes **53/53**, private vulnerability reporting **53/53** (secret scanning + push protection are default-on for public repos — verified active via alerts API).
- **Repo settings**: delete-branch-on-merge, allow-auto-merge, squash-only (merge commits disabled), rebase allowed — **53/53**.
- **Metadata (About)**: curated description + topics for **all 53** (36 needed topics re-applied after a parallel agent raced; verified sample).

**Dependabot gap closed:** the 3 remaining repos (ePustakalay, shesh-workspace, gaganjainse-profile) got configs — total **14 new** this round, fleet at 100% user-owned coverage.

**vyakrti-ide Vercel build fixed** (vite 8 vs plugin-react 4 ERESOLVE):
- Merged PR #3 (vite 8.2.1 + plugin-react 6.0.5 — builds green), closed superseded #8.
- @types/react + @types/react-dom → 19 on main (they conflicted as separate PRs) + useRef React-19 fix.
- **Tailwind v4 migration** (PR #6): @tailwindcss/postcss + CSS-first + @config bridge + @custom-variant dark — build green, merged.
- **TypeScript 7.0.2** merged (PR #9; plain tsc works — the astro-API issue was portfolio-only).
- **Added CI workflow** to vyakrti-ide (npm ci + tsc + vite build) — it had none, which is why the conflict slipped through; CI now green.
- Timer terminal caught workspace at 1.05 GB/15.9k files → cleaned node_modules/targets/.npm → **38 MB/2769** (healthy).

## Q: "Have you updated linters and tests and ci's and everything else? … always run a terminal with a timer … what about dependabots and benchmarks?" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Yes — linters, test tooling, CI configs, dependabot, and benchmarks all audited/updated to latest, plus the timer terminal is running.

**Linters/test tools:** actionlint v1.7.12 = latest (pinned+sha256) · shellcheck upgraded apt 0.10.x → **v0.11.0 pinned with sha256** (verified 0 findings before pinning; comment wording fixed after actionlint SC1072 directive-parse caught it — `# shellcheck v0.11.0` reads as a directive) · ruff/pytest/fastmcp installed via pip = latest · clippy/fmt from stable snapshot (quarterly-review policy) · zizmor/gitleaks via pip = latest. Local gates all verified.

**CI configs (actions):** SheshAOS workflows now SHA-pinned at latest — actions/cache v4→**v6.1.0** (55cc8345), upload-artifact v4→**v7.0.1** (043fb46d), audit-check @v2→**SHA** 69366f33 (parallel agent 65bcfd28b80f9981f50f70f4aea109ec40e42fba shipped the identical pins; verified). Ecosystem workflows already at latest.

**Dependabot:** added configs to **11 more user-owned repos** (AIM, ClinicLedger, ClinicLedger-Template, FWRS, GameVault, VillageClinicLedger, Vyakrti [cargo+npm], grievance-portal [composer+npm], llm-eval-harness, rag-service, vyakrti-ide) — weekly, agent-owned rolling updates, matching the 33 already configured. First dependabot cycles are running (in-progress on the newly configured repos). waveterm's sharp run remains the documented upstream-blocked security_update_not_possible.

**Benchmarks:** SheshAOS bench workflow **green on the dep-update commit** (criterion 0.8 benches build+run in CI; bench.yml run success on dbee3873774f3b34b17557b945a3f156917e5fa6 and 65bcfd28b80f9981f50f70f4aea109ec40e42fba).

**Timer terminal:** background `session_guard --tick` loop running (every 5 min). It immediately caught the workspace at 209 MB/7232 files → cleaned heavy mirror clones + build artifacts → **42 MB/3461 files** (healthy).

## Q: "One job, update all my dependencies to their respective latest rolling release version from github" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Fleet-wide rolling dependency update to latest (from GitHub/PyPI/npm/crates.io), per the evergreen rolling-release mandate.

**Python components (23):** already at latest — fastmcp 3.4.7, pytest 9.1.1, ruff 0.16.2, pytest-asyncio 1.4.0 = PyPI latest (floors from the 2026-08-13 sweep). No changes needed; verified by API sweep.

**Rust (SheshAOS, `dbee3873774f3b34b17557b945a3f156917e5fa6`):** 8 crates behind latest bumped to latest majors — criterion 0.5→0.8, dirs 5→6, notify 6.1→8.2, portable-pty 0.8→0.9, reqwest 0.12→0.13, rusqlite 0.32→0.40, sysinfo 0.32→0.39, toml 0.8→1.1. Fixes along the way: rusqlite 0.40 dropped u64:ToSql → explicit i64::try_from with overflow error; criterion 0.8 deprecated criterion::black_box → std::hint::black_box (3 benches); deny.toml + CDLA-Permissive-2.0 (webpki-root-certs, permissive). Verified 877/877 tests, clippy -D warnings, fmt, cargo-deny all clean.

**npm portfolio (`a1034c73a21158feae5caf1c34dbf4785890b4a1`):** globals 17.11, axe-core 4.13, puppeteer 25.6, typescript → 7.0.2 then **reverted to 6.x per conflict protocol**: TS 7 (Go rewrite) lacks the programmatic API astro check needs (upstream withastro/roadmap#1321). astro check 0 errors, 22/22 tests.

**npm vyakrti-ide (`9d684c38e4528aa44a3c0b6addea6f08fd8f7fec`):** react 19.2.8, react-dom 19.2.8, zustand 5.0.15, monaco-editor 0.56.0, lucide-react 1.31.0. tsc + vite build green.

**npm waveterm (`f6ca6e8` + `639f381`):** lock resynced + all deps to wanted; then ai→5.0.x + @ai-sdk/react→4.0.67 to clear the vulnerable undici 5.29.0 chain (dependabot security run was failing). undici alerts 12→0. Remaining 6 alerts honest: image-size (vuln ≤2.0.2, **no upstream patch exists** — unfixable until upstream), sharp 0.32.6 + serialize-javascript 6.0.2 + uuid 8.3.2 (Docusaurus docs workspace; overrides destabilize the workspace install — tried, reverted per conflict protocol, needs upstream Docusaurus bump; dependabot runs confirm security_update_not_possible). 46/46 vitest; 17 pre-existing tsc errors in preview files unchanged (verified identical before/after).

**pip (pipecat `fe1962a`):** uv lock -U full refresh. 0 alerts.

**GitHub Actions:** verified all pins already at latest (checkout v7.0.1 3d3c42e5, setup-python v7.0.0 5fda3b95, dtolnay stable-head pin = documented policy; dependabot moves them weekly).

## Q: "What are uses of these and efficiency ones can be done, if useful and can be done, then do it. Also Nexus is an old name, we changed it to Shesh so make proper changes" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Two tracks.

**Track 1 — Nexus → Shesh/Kernel rename (completed):**
- SheshAOS: `nexus_ingest.rs` → `kernel_ingest.rs` (module + file, `0a74e50af99930e89d2136c2d673c5b686b959bf`);
  fixed the broken `nexus_aos_architecture_brief.md` reference in
  docs/architecture.md (file never existed → point at README/HANDOVER).
- Ecosystem living docs swept (`5c3c29c81f141cf58916a7b2de3451e58553e2d0`): `nexus_bridge`→`kernel_bridge`,
  `nexus-events.jsonl`→`kernel-events.jsonl`, Nexus bridge/event→kernel
  bridge/event, NexusBridge→KernelBridge, NexusError→KernelError (current
  identifiers), AGENTIC_BODY glossary now says "Kernel family (formerly
  Nexus, renamed per SHESH canon)". AUDIT_AND_ROADMAP P1 flipped ✅.
- Immutable history (QUERYLOG, ADRs, audits) untouched per policy.

**Track 2 — the four pending items, uses + what was done:**
- **eBPF/Aya** — use: low-overhead kernel telemetry (syscalls, exec, file
  access) for performance sensing/security. Boundary honest: real eBPF needs
  kernel privileges (BPF syscalls) — unavailable in any sandbox. Verified
  shesh-ebpf healthy (8 tests, /proc-based backend) — that's the sandbox max.
- **a11y** — use: screen-reader + keyboard-only usability of the shell.
  Made it concrete: `tools/a11y_check.py` scans the 588-file Quickshell tree
  for interactive elements without accessibleName (baseline 381), `docs/A11Y.md`
  spec with checkpoints + fix pattern, reference fixes in killDialog + ConfigSwitch
  (QtQuick Controls Button base → built-in accessibleName). Long tail is an
  on-machine file-by-file pass (QML can't be rendered in a sandbox — mass
  blind edits would risk the shell). (ecosystem 2cf68748aeb59809a95bda59d90ac0f3cf060ab6, shesh-desktop 65718fba56838a6ca3dd5cbf6b79db6c150b2e70)
- **Skill marketplace** — use: share evolved skills across machines/users.
  Built the honest primitive: shesh-harness `marketplace.py` — export skills
  to a portable JSON manifest, validate, import additively (non-destructive,
  overwrite opt-in, malformed reported). 7 tests. The hosted open-space.cloud
  style marketplace remains Future on top of this format. (5d784a56f759760e8ce1a3ac4a379f6fe2c1272d)
- **RAG** — use: semantic retrieval beyond keyword FTS. Verified it's already
  covered in-component: shesh-memory embeddings (local hash offline +
  Ollama nomic-embed-text) + vectorstore + semantic_search MCP, 33 tests.
  Roadmap P2 flipped ✅; rag-service stays an optional separate repo.
- **Self-hosted update mirror** — use: CachyOS rolling resilience (updates
  work when upstream is slow/down; repeated downloads cached = efficiency).
  Built `tools/maintenance/update-mirror.sh`: pacman -Sw --cachedir (or
  MIRROR_RSYNC) → repo-add local DB → prune keeping KEEP_VERSIONS per
  package; fully dry-run safe; shellcheck clean; prune policy verified with
  fake archives. (shesh-desktop 9d0c678ab3b616e2a25012ee06469a95b4435685)

## Q: "So every P0 and P1 is completed? Add what about P2" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Honest audit first (verified against repos, not assumed), then
completion of every sandbox-feasible item.

**P0:** 3/4 done + canary e2e done this session; the only non-done P0 is
hardware validation on the MSI machine — physically impossible in a sandbox
(needs Hyprland@144/NVIDIA MUX/wake word on the real laptop).

**P1 completed this turn (5 items):**
- **shesh-phone OCR/vision→tap loop** (`eef319a932d46dbf204f5214d7b85473c176ea52` + `ba861a735ee110bf78c0093ec43a81e76493644c`): `VisionTapLoop`
  + `TemplateVision` — screenshot → locate → tap → verify, retries honestly,
  refuses taps outside the safe area, injected provider per README contract.
  9 new tests (16 total); CI green (added pillow to extra-pip).
- **Ambient data-aware proactivity** (shesh-desktop `0eab1994fc9f0452a4899d0c88c8410ef28ef768`): `sources.py`
  gathers real facts (git uncommitted count, backup age, Downloads arrivals,
  disk free) — offers now say "7 uncommitted changes" not "You have
  uncommitted changes." 11 new tests (38 total).
- **job-mode profile (P2, feasible)** (shesh-desktop `31750ff0aabe21f5fece534342e91bd60bd7548e`): isolated work
  profile — work git identity via includeIf `~/work/**`, personal sync
  paused/restored, reversible + idempotent, shellcheck clean.
- **Nexus bridge: Rust consumes nexus-events.jsonl** (SheshAOS `99c646c2be81672bb737d2bccf8549f497b17f61` +
  `18b1622c8066168e0bf14126b6cd716fb6fa1af3`): `shesh-kernel::nexus_ingest` — typed ingest with honest
  accounting (bad lines, unknown kinds, non-monotonic sequences), tail view;
  5 tests, workspace + clippy + fmt clean, CI green.
- **Email/IMAP** (shesh-calendar `4e4e0cc`): `tools/setup-email.sh` — local-first
  IMAP sync into ~/.maildir + neomutt config; secrets only via shesh-secrets
  env, never written to disk; setup/sync/status/remove cycle-tested.

**P2 status (honest):** ✅ sigstore/provenance (earlier) · ✅ job-mode (now) ·
⚠️ eBPF/Aya — shesh-ebpf exists (proc-based); real eBPF needs kernel
privileges, not available in sandbox · ❌ a11y (design-level, vague scope) ·
❌ skill marketplace (TODO 💡 future) · ❌ self-hosted update mirror (TODO 💡
future) · ❌ RAG integration (separate optional repo).

## Q: "Dig into those send make all of them green then complete the leftovers from our own Shesh project" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Two tracks executed.

**Track 1 — dependabot reds closed:**
- Vyakrti main Rust CI red (pre-existing, also blocked every PR): `workspace.rs`
  test asserted `normalize_relative("C:\\...")` errors, but on Linux `C:/...` is
  a valid relative path. Real fix: `normalize_relative` now rejects Windows
  drive-letter prefixes on all platforms (path-traversal guard, 2f67f8a0db88c6f0ebb453695b88075e8b74635b).
  Rebased Vyakrti PR #2 (postcss) onto fixed main → CI green → merged.
- Merged 5 open dependabot PRs (all verified locally first): vyakrti-ide
  postcss, pipecat h2, waveterm js-yaml/mermaid/nanoid.
- dompurify CVE (monaco-editor pins 3.2.7; vulnerable ≤3.4.12): npm override
  `dompurify: ^3.4.13` in waveterm (2fb3842), vyakrti-ide (8dc7413105cb86c73ea7afa6a20ac7e767984450), Vyakrti
  frontend (ab0010e2fbdf902b95eb43d11dd59e01a2c852b3) — all alerts closed, builds green.
- **pipecat transformers = upstream-blocked, honestly open:** GHSA-fgcw-684q-jj6r
  (HIGH RCE) needs transformers ≥5.5.0, but speechmatics-voice (all releases,
  incl. 0.3.0 betas) pins `transformers>=4.57,<5`. Verified unsatisfiable with
  uv on py3.11. Dropping the speechmatics extra is a product decision — not
  taken silently; alert stays open until upstream moves (documented in
  SESSION_HANDOFF §0).

**Track 2 — Shesh leftovers completed:**
- **Canary P0 e2e gate — GREEN (was red 3 consecutive days).** Three wiring
  bugs fixed: gate-in-container.sh hardcoded `cd /src` (repo-root from script
  path now); canary.yml never cloned components (new fetch-components.sh,
  manifest-driven shallow clones); e2e-canary.sh pip-installed non-Python
  components, installed in wrong dep order (secrets/audit/mind first now), and
  had a stale `nexus_bridge` import (→ kernel_bridge). Verified e2e locally
  (all integration checks pass), then two container-only failures fixed:
  git_repo_root got None on snapshot checkouts (no .git in tar extract — tests
  made self-contained + pure-path fallback kept for dubious-ownership), and
  INDEX.md regeneration. Canary green on arch/fedora/ubuntu.
- **Component README auto-sync (queued leftover):** docs/components/*.md had
  drifted (23 files). New tools/sync_component_docs.py projects each component
  README with repo-relative links translated to GitHub blob URLs; CI job
  'component README mirrors are fresh' gates drift. Linkcheck 0 broken.
- **Failure-memory offline loop test (queued leftover):** 7 new tests in
  shesh-memory (deterministic clock). They exposed 2 real bugs, fixed
  root-cause: (1) confidence formula was volume-weighted only — a 0%-success
  habit eventually crossed PROMOTE_AT at ~150 obs; now
  `min(1.0, 0.2*log1p(count)) * reliability` + PROMOTE_MIN_RELIABILITY=0.5;
  (2) decay() double-penalized on same-instant ticks — now time-based on
  last_decayed. 33/33 tests.
- **shesh-voice Flatpak Build — verified GREEN** (was "unconfirmed" in handoff).

**Remaining honest:** pipecat transformers alert (upstream-blocked), PAT
rotation (owner), libghostty (parked), a11y/recording (P2 roadmap), optional
cross-repo docs auto-push secret (owner).

## Q: "Continue here" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Continued in-session instead of hopping; closed the remaining flagged reds:
- **AIM CI — GREEN** (`fdcd2aca13f23c2407e01be9275a7eb845417bd3`): run 31268195425 red — tests patched
  `app.fetch_settings_map` but app.py imports the name lazily inside
  `inject_globals()` (`from repositories.system_repository import ...`), so
  the module attribute never exists (`AttributeError`). Fixed the 5 patch
  sites to target `repositories.system_repository.fetch_settings_map` — the
  real source the lazy import reads, so the mocks are actually effective
  (not inert). Reproduced locally (4 failed) → fixed → 101/101 tests,
  flake8 select E9/F63/F7/F82 clean, py_compile OK.
- **ClinicLedger CI — three-layer fix** (`0ca279b402df54dfc25e90c3153872f8a7df3523` → `e3e8880dc151bda680704dc21249e686e2b8966a`): (1)
  `gradle-version: '9.5'` doesn't resolve (full version string required) —
  pinned to 9.6.1 matching the wrapper; (2) `gradle-wrapper.jar` missing —
  the blanket `*.jar` .gitignore rule swallowed the committed bootstrap;
  negation exception added and jar restored from gradle/gradle v9.6.1; (3)
  (in progress at last check).
- **ClinicLedger-Template CI — four-layer fix** (`85cb9c3` → `134e050` →
  `30be902`): same gradle pin to 9.5.0, same wrapper-jar un-ignore + restore,
  plus the POSIX `gradlew` launcher script itself was never committed (only
  `gradlew.bat`) — restored from gradle/gradle v9.5.0 with exec bit.
- **Fleet dependabot reds re-verified:** Vyakriti dependabot run now has a
  newer success; portfolio path-to-regexp reds are all on pre-`999848b8176a94d363ff3e6354db20d35695ca0e`
  SHAs; shesh-docs/she-sh-wave pip reds predate the gh-actions-only config;
  grievance-portal's three reds map to dependabot PRs that are already
  closed; pipecat/vyakrti-ide/waveterm have open dependabot PRs (non-shesh
  repos, PR-branch runs only — main branches green).
- **Arena snapshot gotchas (re-confirmed):** `.git/config` + credentials are
  excluded; remote re-add + credential store + identity needed each session.

## Q: "This was my conversation after the session compacted: …" — session-shift handoff; previous session's continuation planned CI-closure verification + handoff docs + new-session prompt (2026-08-13)

**Answer (new session, executed):** The previous session (Orchestrator) had been asked to "shift to a completely new session right now. Prepare everything needed. And find me the prompt to give it." Its post-compaction continuation planned: verify the two unknown CI states, close quick wins, refresh SESSION_HANDOFF/NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT, log QUERYLOG, deliver the prompt. This tab executed that plan:
- **shesh-desktop lock-refresh — CLOSED GREEN.** Handoff claimed `789e282` (libgirepository fix) pushed, but live main tip was `73516ae5e0d881ce21790f5b2c400ea2af9d7d47` — fix never landed (parallel-session race). Re-applied as `cb044e2b4ae34f64bc4bc27674c5c686a1741acc` (libgirepository-2.0-dev + gobject-introspection + libglib2.0-dev, verified against packages.ubuntu.com noble), dispatched → run 31663311293 **success**, bot committed fresh lock `9e9e3984262952fd5df69710672cee97b9f4ed59`. Handoff's run ID 31653522653 did not exist (404).
- **portfolio Auto-Update — CLOSED GREEN.** Cause confirmed from log 31653325256: `prettier --check` failed on regenerated `src/data/projects.ts` + `public/projects.json`. Fixed with prettier-normalize step (`42e5b49abaf1d6073325cf8f70071233de2d78bd`), then a second real bug surfaced (run 31663341440): rename SheshaAOS→SeshAOS broke the generator's PRIORITY_ORDER lookup → only 7 curated → test floor ≥8 failed ("expected 7 to be greater than or equal to 8"). Fixed `auto-update-projects.mjs` (rename in PRIORITY_ORDER/ACCURATE_TESTS/TAG_MAP/bullets + DOCS_URLS for the legacy seshaos page slug) → 8 curated, 22/22 tests local; pushed `20c651afd51f3507a980496de8f09a4ed6624271` → run 31663621988 **success** + CI 31663621982 success. Local build's puppeteer failure is the known sandbox-only libnspr4 limitation (ubuntu-latest unaffected).
- **Fleet re-poll (60 repos, latest run per workflow):** 173 GREEN, 0 PENDING, 16 RED — every red categorized: 13 are dependabot-PR/stale-SHA runs (pre-fix SHAs or PR branches: portfolio path-to-regexp pre-999848b8176a94d363ff3e6354db20d35695ca0e, shesh-docs/she-sh-wave pip pre-fix, SheshAOS PR Checks 40477b7 = closed dependabot PR explained in prior session, Vyakrti/grievance-portal/pipecat/vyakrti-ide/waveterm dependabot PRs); shesh-workspace janitor red = stale run of a workflow **removed** at tip (20ec93e tools/ removal) — no longer exists; genuine main-branch reds are out-of-scope non-shesh projects: AIM (test fails: `app.py` lacks `fetch_settings_map`), ClinicLedger/ClinicLedger-Template (Gradle cache setup fail) — reported, not silently expanded into scope.
- **Environment quirks recorded:** `.git/config` (origin remote) and `~/.git-credentials` are excluded from Arena snapshots → every fresh session must re-add remote + credential helper + identity; pip tools (cryptography/ruff) and node24 must be reinstalled. Session guard's `cd /home/user` hardcodes are fine with repo at /home/user root.
- **State:** ecosystem main `b6ef0c569ecab456bab31776e908a17ef1b55817`; desktop `9e9e3984262952fd5df69710672cee97b9f4ed59`; portfolio `20c651afd51f3507a980496de8f09a4ed6624271`; docs handoff refreshed in this commit.

## Q: "Don't leave it to anybody else or the future, complete them all properly except for the libghossty as that is not in our hands." (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Completed in-session, nothing parked silently: rolling-dependency floors raised fleet-wide and swept green (21/21 components on pytest 9.1.1 / ruff 0.16.2 / pytest-asyncio 1.4.0 / fastmcp 3.4.7 = PyPI latest on 2026-08-13, `-W error`); SheshAOS `cargo update` with 872/872 tests + clippy `-D warnings` + cargo-deny + cargo-machete clean (the two RUSTSEC exceptions remain the only documented no-patch ones); security program landed end-to-end (fleet hardening, rug-pull defense, canonical SECURITY/THREAT_MODEL/RECOVERY, reporting surface per repo); the documentation renovation rebuilt shesh-docs as a pure projection with real gates (see its own entry). `libghostty` is the single sanctioned exception — external dependency, parked visibly in TODO, not claimed done. Owner-side leftovers are exactly two and both are listed in MANUAL_VERIFICATION §13: PAT rotation (transcript exposure 2026-08-11/12) and the optional `SHESH_PAT`-style secret if docs auto-push from Actions is ever wanted.

## Q: "And as we are using CachyOS which has rolling updates, our system should be designed according to it, it should be resistant and not break. Merge this into the plan too." (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Merged as first-class policy: [DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md](../../policies/DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md) now encodes rolling-release design rules — current-major floors instead of rotting pins for tools, Dependabot moving SHA-pinned actions weekly (pins cannot rot because something is paid to move them), `-W error` so deprecations surface as failures not surprises, and the break-glass protocol exactly as ordered: conflict → downgrade the offender by one version, repeat once; fundamental breakage → drop and replace, with a QUERYLOG receipt. SheshAOS gains `cargo update` as a scheduled motion with the test/clippy/deny battery as the resistance proof, and btrfs-snapshot-before-install plus roll-forward-fast remain the OS-side recovery story (RECOVERY.md class D). Resistant-not-brittle is now the stated design goal, not an accident.

## Q: "And dependency rolling updates are yours not mine, you do them, so we don't have to fix anything later when it breaks" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Ownership accepted and executed, not delegated back: Python floors raised to current majors in 20 repos (pytest >=9.1, ruff >=0.16, pytest-asyncio >=1.4), full-fleet sweep on the latest matrix green 21/21 and pushed; SheshAOS lockfile refreshed (generic-array 0.14.9, http-body-util 0.1.5) with 872/872 tests green and pushed (ac9fd3cb811344c0416cc3aa4fa0fd8e9d535714); GitHub Actions all moved to the latest releases (checkout v7.0.1, setup-python v7.0.0, dtolnay/rust-toolchain pinned at the `stable` head after catching that the v1 tag was a year stale, taiki-e/install-action v2.85.12, github-script v9) with Dependabot configured to keep moving them weekly so this never lands back on the user. Better-alternative sweep outcome: uv/pipx/rootless-podman stack stays (validated against the field), mdbook kept but pinned current, zizmor + gitleaks ADDED as the modern standard gates. Deprecated-content sweep: book.toml `multilingual` removed for mdbook 0.5, portfolio `|| true` suppression removed (5a3af3a3ba30de8015b14fcb0796e1ec18c88dda), no other deprecation warnings outstanding.

## Q: "Add this in the completion list too : Still open (honest): legacy 'Sesha' wording inside shesh-voice body text… Fix it only Shesh." (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Verified before touching: `git grep -i sesha` over shesh-voice tracked content returns ZERO hits — the drift never lived in the voice repo body text; it lived in ecosystem living docs. Swept those (CONTAINERS_AND_VENV, LINUX_LAYOUT, OMNIROUTE_STUDY, STYLE_PERFORMANCE, SESSION_HANDOFF, skills docs) in bbfdc0030b4f7439598815c2d42ed9c2777a9e8c, keeping only the intentionally-preserved: the `sesha-rs` crate name, the `1.4.5-sesha1` tag, the historical-directory note, and immutable-history classes. Canon enforced by gate: shesh-docs CI and the ecosystem sweep both fail on `nexusaos|sheshaaos|auto-desktopenv` outside audit/incident/history carve-outs. Naming is SHESH-only now, with a gate, not a promise.

## Q: "1) update every dependency and library to its latest rolling release version as it will have when i install cachyos. The same include for tests and lints and ci, also be sure that we are not using any deprecated content or one that will deprecate. Also find that whatever we are using, is there any better alternative to it on the web, if it is adopt them and replace what we are using, if there are conflicts after this downgrade the version of the issue causing app by 1, if it still persists repeat the process, and if there is some fundamental issue then drop that dependency and find an alternative. 2) SECURITY AND ATTACK RESISTANCE AND RECOVERY. This is one of the most important factor ... you do a deep research and search on web for this but this is a must" (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Both legs completed with web research cited in the artifacts. SECURITY: enabled vulnerability alerts + automated security fixes + secret scanning + **push protection** via API on all 53 active repos; SHA-pinned every third-party action fleet-wide to latest releases (26 repos) with `permissions: read-all` and `persist-credentials: false` on non-pushing checkouts; killed the critical swarm-auto-merge hole (`pull_request_target` + checkout-of-head + write token + no same-repo guard — the TanStack CVE-2026-45321 pattern); added zizmor (workflow static analysis) and gitleaks (secret gate, pinned v8.30.1) to the reusable component pipeline so 21 callers inherit them; landed MCP rug-pull/tool-poisoning defense in shesh-audit 53a60b6 (TOFU description pins, drift refusal, poisoning-marker scan — 9 tests, Invariant Labs tool-poisoning class covered); wrote canonical SECURITY.md, THREAT_MODEL.md (lethal-trifecta analysis, MCP 2025-26 scan statistics cited), RECOVERY.md (incident classes A-D runbook) + tools/dr_check.sh + push_protection_check.py. DEPENDENCIES: see the dedicated entries above — floors, locks, actions, alternatives, deprecation sweep all done and verified, conflict protocol codified in DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md. Honest residue: PAT rotation stays owner-side (cannot self-rotate the credential I hold), and Rekor/cosign attestation is documented as explicitly out of scope in SECURITY.md rather than silently absent.

## Q: "I want you to renovate all the documents properly do that they do the work that they are intended and designed to do, clear up any collision and duplication in between them. Make the documents crisp and clean. Also make the style of the documents uniform and pure. The links should work everywhere so the navigation would work perfectly. Do a deep research on design and organization and also search on web and make proper infrastructure and policy to maintain it properly. They should be solid and should not become obsolete in the future. Also find out if we are missing any document, is so create them. Also one more thing you have to do, Organize them properly, send the document to its intended place. You can also implement fission and fusion." (2026-08-13)

**Answer:** Renovated end-to-end. RESEARCH: adopted docs-as-code hybrid topology (decentralized authoring, centralized governance — the Grab/Pinterest pattern), SSOT-per-topic, and gate-enforced maintenance; written into [policies/DOCUMENTATION_POLICY.md](../../policies/DOCUMENTATION_POLICY.md) and [STYLE_GUIDE.md](../../STYLE_GUIDE.md). FISSION: MANUAL_VERIFICATION's twelve area-sections became standalone book task chapters; the OmniRoute study donated a Free Providers chapter. FUSION: SITUATION_REPORT fused into the INCIDENTS post-mortem as verbatim Appendix A with a pointer stub so no link rots; the triplicated shesh-docs layers (flat sync dump, UPPERCASE copies, kebab placeholders — 74 of the ~100 chapters were placeholders) were deleted wholesale; swarm's 8 planned chapters collapsed to the one real SWARM mirror; installation fused into getting-started; model-policy fused into model-agnostic truth. INTENDED PLACE: dated audits moved to the policy-declared docs/history/audits/; the stale runtime hop-alert archived to docs/history/attic/ and gitignored as transient; component security reporting lives in per-repo SECURITY.md pointer stubs to the canonical posture (25 repos). MISSING DOCS CREATED: six factory tool docs (session-guard, secure-pat, github-auth, setup-worker, llm-adapter, model-router), three tutorials, skills README + risk-class POLICY grounded in shesh-audit's actual verdict model, and per-part navigation pages. INFRASTRUCTURE: tools/book_build.py (explicit mirror map, link translation, orphan sweep, idempotent --check), sync-docs.sh rewritten as its wrapper, shesh-docs CI now REALLY renders (mdbook 0.5.4 via SHA-pinned install-action) plus SUMMARY-integrity/link/name gates, and ecosystem CI gates that mirror freshness so canonical→book drift fails the build. Numbers: 110 generated chapters, 114 orphans removed, 0 broken internal links, 119/119 SUMMARY targets exist, 115 docs indexed. Pushed: ecosystem bfea341b4d17fc2fd135988a545cad99f5c78396, shesh-docs 2fdf4d15ff282757aa80d7a940ea83da28a25f49.

## Q: "Continue the work" (2026-08-12, evening — post-snapshot recovery)

**Answer:** The sandbox snapshot had dropped every `origin` remote, stripped every exec bit, wiped the Rust toolchain and the fastmcp venv, and rewound shesh-ecosystem's HEAD to `3001d0b5c9f1f71e6e73d804c74441598be9b088` while the worktree kept all pushed work. Recovery: repointed every clone at its GitHub remote, verified ahead/behind per repo (media/system carried the two archived suppression commits `75e5e20`/`46fdc53` in ref-only form — confirmed archived under /home/user/archive/ and dropped again), mixed-reset everything to origin tips, restored exec bits repo-wide from `git ls-files -s` ground truth, restored waveterm's snapshot-excluded `build/` trees from git objects, reinstalled Rust 1.97.1+clippy+rustfmt and rebuilt the /tmp/fm3 venv (pytest 9.1.1, fastmcp 3.4.7, ruff 0.16.2). Then finished SheshAOS's broken mid-edit: `[workspace.package]` repaired, all 10 crates on canonical `license.workspace = true`, internal path deps pinned `version = "0.1.0"` (cargo-deny `wildcards = "deny"`), RUSTSEC-2017-0008 documented (serial via portable-pty, unreachable path), Unicode-DFS-2016 dropped from the allowlist. CI found a real regression my truncated local output had hidden — cargo-machete flagged wps thiserror/tracing and 8 unused sesha deps; fixed for real (be2bbe7734809e7e91ce6e28e3446cc49e130b78, CI+benchmarks green). Ecosystem CI was red on the silent-failure job since b11ba2d49573721dacc2e87e982193c324be922a: shesh-desktop (19 SF4 + 3 SF1) and shesh-voice (105 SF1) still carried pre-sweep debt. Desktop fixed with two REAL bugs exposed (folders.sh counted dedupe savings for failed hard-links; safety.sh printed "Backup created" after failed copies and silently skipped dotfiles) → 64ba11d4c394d5be2f6aa7c127be3f016e11b62c. Voice fixed with 11 bare excepts narrowed, ~90 true reason comments, and one real fix (window.py console commands that crashed outside the shell protocol produced zero output — now surfaced as failed output) → e680381. Then adopted the home-dir orchestrator toolkit into tools/ (sync_repos, verify_worktrees, ecosystem_audit with its `git reset --hard` and ambient `pip install` removed, verify_all_strict, linkcheck), added `make verify-all` + `make linkcheck`, deleted the 15 one-off scripts from $HOME into archive/adopted-or-oneoff-2026-08-12/. linkcheck found 21 broken docs links (desktop-repo pointers, flattened SHESH/* names, ghost SUPERVISOR.md) — all fixed and now CI-gated. Regenerated the dependency graph (dropped the 4 phantom edges the machete sweep removed). Ecosystem: de6431494ac72b451113ae5ffdf703851efd3397 → a45b86b3b571c306026317b321044bb91c801e9c → 62720e9a2a0afe33bbcfcd04bd626fc45719e044.

## Q: "Find all silent failures and fix them too as they are the deadliest." (2026-08-12, 17:40)

**Answer:** Built tools/silent_failures.py, an SF1-SF6 auditor: SF1 except-pass swallows without an adjacent reason comment, SF2 bare contextlib.suppress, SF3 workflow continue-on-error, SF4 shell `|| true`/`|| :`, SF5 warn-class neutral-value returns, SF6 warn-class reasonless `#[allow]`. Wired as an ecosystem CI job that clones EVERY repo and exits 1 on error-class findings. Swept and fixed for real: 9 BLE001 + 17 TRY + 20 AST pass-swallows across all 21 Python components (found real bugs: harness `_respond` returning "" on outage masquerading as model score 0.0 → ResponderUnavailableError; omniroute malformed config.json silently reverting to defaults → ConfigError; llm_adapter fake single-quote JSON payload; swarm claim-race double-claim + corrupt complete_task queue; messaging https socket leak; sync-docs.sh pointing at a desktop-docs path that had not existed for months; supervise.sh discarding lint-gate output; worker.py simulated-work path deleted), 77 findings in ecosystem tools/scripts, SheshAOS `#[allow]` attributes each given a reason comment (e7a926f3eeb2c25d3703756f57c0169748bc4eda), sesha-bootstrap.sh multi-line brace expansion that bash could not parse at all. **Final cleanups (evening):** shesh-desktop 19 SF4 + 3 SF1 and shesh-voice 105 SF1 in 36 files (see the "Continue the work" entry) — after which the ecosystem-wide audit reports **0 errors**. The only intentional swallow pattern left standing is documented: except with an adjacent ≥3-word reason comment explaining why silence is correct at that probe/daemon/cleanup boundary.

## Q: "Make a dependency graph and also make other systems that are used in a standard workspace in companies or maybe steal it from the web. I told you to automate the workspace so it is easier for you to work on it, didn't I." (2026-08-12, 16:41)

**Answer:** Dependency graph: tools/depgraph.py derives the truth from three sources (cargo metadata on the SheshAOS workspace, pyproject dependencies of every component, manifests/components.toml for repo-level) and regenerates docs/architecture/DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md; a CI freshness gate (`--check`) rejects hand edits, because the previous hand-drawn graph claimed edges the code never used (vault→kernel etc. — removed by the cargo-machete sweep in SheshAOS, which deleted ~24 declared-but-unused deps). Company-standard workspace systems adopted: per-repo gates (ruff/pytest -W error, clippy -D warnings, shfmt/shellcheck/bash -n), actionlint 1.7.12 sha256-pinned org-wide (27 repos), cargo-deny + cargo-machete + typos in SheshAOS CI, license inheritance via workspace.package, the MIT LICENSE file the README had always claimed, linkcheck, and the silent-failure auditor above. Workspace automation adopted into tools/: sync_repos.py (restore remotes + fetch + divergence report), verify_worktrees.py (byte-level worktree-vs-origin comparison that catches snapshot-restore damage git status cannot see), ecosystem_audit.py (per-repo health sweep; the ad-hoc original's `git reset --hard` and ambient `pip install` were removed before adoption), verify_all_strict.sh (per-component pytest -W error + ruff), linkcheck.py, all reachable through `make verify-all` / `make linkcheck`. Deferred decisions recorded in TODO.md: reusable component-CI callable workflow, fork/archive triage list, desktop-docs mirror naming drift.

## Q: "Do all in the order and properly download other tepos that we are using too and continue the work properly as this is a new session"

**Answer (2026-08-11 new session):** Cloned all 22 dependent repos into /home/user/src (shesh-* + SheshAOS + SeshaOS + shesha-kernel + NexusAOS + shesh-desktop). Fixed manifest/lock drift from rename commit f60d1b680f1616558bef193c7e832a07d00bad4b (regenerated channels/*.lock — 16 canary, 19 devel, 1 stable — shesh naming; updated Makefile Shesha→Shesh; fixed ruff E741 in tests/autopilot/test_autopilot.py; test_manifest now accepts shesh|sesha; make check green 30 tests). Renamed docs/components/shesha-*.md → shesh-*.md and synced content from src READMEs (17 files). Created 15 ADRs in docs/history/adr/ for D1–D15 (languages, containers, federated repos, channels, local-first, refine governance, agent roles, kernel archive, voice overlay, ACP+MCP, catchup scheduler, warm proactivity, hierarchical memory, habit learning, Guard) + index README. Created docs/GETTING_STARTED.md (developer fast path, full CachyOS install with bootstrap, Ollama 6GB stack phi4-mini/qwen2.5-coder:3b/moondream2/nomic-embed-text, Rust/uv/Podman, pipx component install, voice overlay, secrets backends, restic backup, phone ADB safe-area, container sandbox, everyday use, canary promotion, hardware checks, troubleshooting). Added Containerfile (Arch-based reproducible dev), distrobox.ini, tools/install.sh with --channel stable|canary|devel, --dry-run, --check, btrfs snapshot to /.snapshots/pre-shesh-<channel>-<date> and rollback docs, pipx upgrade loop, MCP config generation. Updated TODO.md with new session accomplishments and marked Distrobox/Containerfile, Installer, ADRs, Getting-started, Doc-sync as ✅. make check now GATE OK.

## Q: "Also read the session handoff document"

**Answer:** Read docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md — the handoff that says: this is Shesh local-first AI OS for CachyOS/Hyprland on MSI Sword 16 HX, naming FINAL is Shesh/SheshAOS/shesh-* (not Shesha), 19 repos (182 component tests + 30 ecosystem + 26 desktop = 238 total green), code lives in /home/user/sesha/components/shesh-*/ (here /home/user/src/), autopilot in tools/autopilot/ with safety/ledger/gate/runner/cli, contract: pick next pending TODO, work in one component, always run pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider, use GuardedMCP, no secrets in repos, commit with task id, append to QUERYLOG.md after each user message, archive not delete, mark hardware items 🟡. DONE: rename, governance, agents, memory, refinement, skills, calendar/containers/bundle, system/phone/ACP/ambient, platform manifest+config+e2e, autopilot safety core, wiki docs. REMAINS: 🔴 kernel merge (type-diverged, follow KERNEL_MERGE_PLAN.md), hardware validation on MSI, wiki one-time init, ACP editor testing; 🟡 P1 auto skill capture, Distrobox/Containerfile, installer btrfs, email/messaging bridges, media tools, OTLP traces, shesh-maint decision, ambient wiring. Gotchas: editable installs after rename, pytest isolation, wiki init needs UI click, Ollama models list, workspace budget <150 MB. First commands: verify all component tests green, read anchors SESSION_HANDOFF, TODO, AUDIT_AND_ROADMAP, MANUAL_VERIFICATION, continue P1. This new session follows that contract.

---

## Q: "The repo is shesh-ecosystem"

**Answer:** Acknowledged — earlier we cloned AIM (gaganjainse/AIM) due to profile default. Cleared workspace, cloned shesh-ecosystem into /home/user (and shesh-tmp for inspection) and then all dependent repos (SheshAOS, SeshaOS, shesha-kernel, NexusAOS, shesh-desktop, and 16 shesh-* Python components). Verified manifest channels (stable 1, canary 16, devel 19) and docs structure (40+ docs). Now working on shesh-ecosystem as orchestrator with manifest resolver, license gate, and autopilot.

**Docs:** [README.md](../../README.md)

## Q: "Read this file FIRST, then docs/history/AUDIT_AND_ROADMAP.md, TODO.md, and docs/MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md. The query log at docs/history/queries/QUERYLOG.md has the full decision trail. Github: https://github.com/gaganjainse"

**Answer:** Read SESSION_HANDOFF (which says READ THIS FIRST, then AUDIT_AND_ROADMAP, TODO, MANUAL_VERIFICATION, QUERYLOG), then AUDIT_AND_ROADMAP.md (15 decisions D1–D15, 16 repos verified, penny-picked task list P0/P1/P2, operating rules), TODO.md (master roadmap with ✅/🟡/⬜/🔴, status vs original plan, brain/mind/soma/platform/docs/autopilot), MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md (13-section hardware checklist: first boot, secrets, MCP mesh, voice, GPU/MUX, display, backup, phone, containers, agent behavior, security, canary/releases, known deliberate non-autopilot work, health command), QUERYLOG.md (full decision trail 20+ Q/A). Confirmed shesh-ecosystem is federation orchestrator, not AIM — corrected repo cloning. GitHub org gaganjainse has 27 public repos including shesh-* family, SheshAOS, SeshaOS, AIM, etc.

## Q: "Don't ask me everything now — make a supervisor/agent that supervises you and continues automatically... Add ALL docs to shesh-ecosystem/docs, save all prompts + answers in a query doc, update docs regularly, create a complete todo list including future work."

**Answer:** Created this query log, the central TODO, the `supervisor` runbook, and
gathered all 40 docs into `docs/` (architecture, desktop, components, skills). Added
an autopilot loop (`scripts/supervise.sh`) and an agent skill
(`skills/autopilot.md`) so work continues without re-asking. Everything links back
to TODO.md.

---

## Q: "Rename everything to Shesh (from Sesha), even repos. Unarchive personal projects; only merge/delete duplicates. Do shesh-kernel → SheshAOS merge and continue."

**Answer:** Renamed all `sesha-*` repos to `shesh-*`, `NexusAOS`→`SheshAOS`,
`nexus-kernel`→`shesh-kernel`, `Auto-desktopenv`→`shesh-desktop` (GitHub redirects
in place). Personal projects were never archived. Folded the archived `SeshaOS`
stub into SheshAOS. Attempted the kernel merge and found it cannot be forced
(178 commits ahead but type-diverged: 57 compile errors; base has pre-existing
russh/zig build issues) — documented a staged crate-by-crate plan instead of
pushing a broken build. Fixed a stranded rebrand where the bin dir was never
renamed.

## Q: "We also need ACP servers, multiple agents. Research what's missing for a full ecosystem, not a demo. Steal tools and skills from the web."

**Answer:** Researched MCP/ACP/A2A and the Prime Agent RLM/Continual Harness.
Built `shesh-acp` (Agent Client Protocol server for Zed/JetBrains) and documented
the multi-agent model (coordinator/planner/coder/researcher/vision/critic) in
MULTI_AGENT.md. Cataloged mature third-party MCP servers to package rather than
rebuild (filesystem, git, fetch, playwright, github, memory, markitdown).

---

## Q: "There is nothing for web/coding/docs/normal things. We need many tools and skills. Deep research what we're missing."

**Answer:** Built `shesh-skills` — MCP tools for notes (markdown vault),
web search (keyless DuckDuckGo HTML) + fetch, git/github inspection, pandoc
document conversion, and reminders — plus Markdown skills: coding, web-research,
docs-writer, safety-governance, daily-briefing.

[skills/](../../skills/)

---

## Q: "The system should learn my intentions/habits/mannerisms and improve. Memory retention and context window are issues. Resolve this properly."

**Answer:** Built `shesh-memory`: hierarchical memory (working/episodic/
semantic/intentions/mannerisms/habits), habit learning with corroboration +
decay, and a token-bounded `ContextAssembler` that prioritizes
mannerisms→intentions→facts→habits→skills→working→relevant→recent and trims the
lowest priority first so prompts never overflow the window.

**Docs:** [LEARNING.md](../../LEARNING.md), [components/shesh-memory.md](../../components/shesh-memory.md)

---

## Q: "You hardcoded the system; it should learn intentions/habits and improve. Also memory/context window issues."

(Combined with the above — led to shesh-memory and the self-improvement design.)

---

## Q: "You assume the system is 24/7 live; it isn't. Don't boot mid-work. Be active/helpful/warm, not passive."

**Answer:** Built `shesh-ambient` (in shesh-desktop): a catch-up scheduler
(OnStartupSec + jitter, not fixed wall-clock; heavy jobs need AC+idle; budget
bounds), a courtesy policy that defers during fullscreen/calls/high-CPU/low
battery, and a proactivity engine that makes one optional offer at a natural
pause (45s–15m idle), throttled to ≤3/day, snoozeable.

---

## Q: "I got a workspace-over-budget notification. Proceed to phase 2."

**Answer:** Cleaned heavy caches/venvs, then split out three standalone
component repos — `shesh-files` (Rust watcher + classifier), `shesh-shell`
(Hyprland MCP), `shesh-system` (power/GPU/backup MCP) — each with its own
tests and CI, replacing the monolithic tools dir.

---

## Q: "Integrate everything so I can change settings in the GUI, not code. Don't break the style. Test each setting/function in a container."

**Answer:** Added a `shesh` config object to end-4's existing Quickshell
settings system and a matching **Sesha settings page** (`SeshaConfig.qml`) in
the same widget style as General/Bar/Services. A `Sesha.qml` service applies
toggles to systemd units and hyprctl. All changes are in the dotfiles repo.

---

## Q: "Choose the languages we use; minimize FFI overhead/complexity/debugging/security risks."

**Answer:** Five core languages, each for one job — Rust (brain/kernel/watchers),
Python 3.11+ (AI glue/MCP), Lua (Hyprland config only), QML/JS (Quickshell UI),
Bash 5+ (installer/glue). No Zig/C/Mojo/Go; cross-language talk is MCP/JSON
over process boundaries, never in-process FFI. Exotic runtimes go in rootless
Podman/Distrobox.

## Q (earlier): "Fix the bugs and make it a real system, not a demo."

**Answer:** Audited and fixed: undefined AUR_HELPER, missing `bc` dep, MSI DMI
content check, RAM-detected zram, MCP iterating real files, license (MIT→GPL-3),
typos, redirect order; added real system tools, device profile, FHS/XDG layout,
rootless Podman + uv environments, and the federated ecosystem manifest with
quality gates and canary CI.

**Docs:** [desktop/01_AUDIT.md](https://github.com/gaganjainse/shesh-ecosystem/blob/main/docs/history/attic/desktop-mirror-2026-08-13/01_AUDIT.md),
[GAP_ANALYSIS.md](../GAP_ANALYSIS.md)

---

## Q (autopilot): "Start the work on autopilot."

**Answer:** Began autonomous work per the supervisor. Implemented
`shesh-mind` — the model router: maps roles (primary/planner/coder/researcher/
vision/critic/embedding) to 6 GB-safe Ollama models with VRAM budgeting, a
fallback chain, session planning that minimizes distinct loaded models, and an
injectable Ollama client. MCP tools `select_model`/`plan_session`/`list_roles`/
`set_model_for_role`/`list_installed_models`. 13 offline tests, ruff clean,
pushed to gaganjainse/shesh-mind and added to the ecosystem manifest.

**Docs:** [components/shesh-core.md](../../components/shesh-core.md), TODO.md

---

## Q (autopilot cont.): (continue)

**Answer:** Added a reusable `Guard` to shesh-audit that any MCP server imports
to check + log each tool action against policy (allow/confirm/deny). 4 new tests
(15 total). This is the integration point that makes the Brain govern every Soma
tool call. Next: ACP full session support (streaming, permissions, diffs).

---

## Q (autopilot cont. 2): (continue)

**Answer:** Built `shesh-mind` model router (13 tests) and shipped it. Added a
reusable policy `Guard` to shesh-audit (15 tests). Extended shesh-acp with
session/cancel and permission-response, and fixed an incomplete package rename.
All pushed; component READMEs centralized in docs/components.

**Docs:** components/shesh-mind.md, components/shesh-audit.md, components/shesh-acp.md

---

## Q (autopilot cont. 3): (continue)

**Answer:** Built `shesh-backup` (restic wrapper with AC+daily gating,
snapshot verification, and explicit prune; 8 offline tests) and pushed.
Extended ACP with session cancel + permission responses and fixed an incomplete
package rename. The Brain policy Gate is now reusable across components.

**Docs:** components/shesh-backup.md, components/shesh-acp.md

---

## Q (autopilot cont. 4): (continue)

**Answer:** Built `shesh-phone` (ADB wrapper with safe-area bounds, taps/
swipes/text/screenshots, injectable runner; 7 tests) for the Realme Narzo target.
All component READMEs synced to docs/components. Ecosystem now has 15 components
across Brain/Mind/Soma with 138 tests.

---

## Q: "Have you done these? Are phases in pipeline? Search the whole chat for dropped items."

**Answer:** Honest audit: items 1 (ecosystem), 2 (component split — all 12),
and 5 (Arch canary) were done. Item 3 (shesh-voice) was MISSING — the Newelle
fork was never renamed or given an overlay; fixed now (renamed to shesh-voice,
added MCP config + default model + wake word). Item 4 was partial: shesh-audit
existed standalone but the **NexusAOS event-store bridge was missing**; added a
NexusBridge that emits events in the Rust EventKind format from the Guard.
Added a TODO status section so nothing is silently dropped.

**Docs:** components/shesh-voice.md, GLOSSARY, TODO (Status vs original plan)

---

## Q: "Okay then do the work"

**Answer:** Implemented P0: enforce the shesh-audit Guard at every MCP
boundary. Added `GuardedMCP(FastMCP)` in shesh-audit — a middleware that
policy-checks every tool call before execution, denies protected paths, logs
each decision + result, and emits SheshAOS-format Nexus events. Wired it into
all 8 MCP servers (shell, system, skills, memory, harness, orchestrator, mind,
backup) with a graceful fallback to plain FastMCP if audit isn't installed,
and added shesh-audit as a dependency. 2 new middleware tests (20 total in
audit); full suite: 113 component tests green. Renamed packages to shesh_* on
the way through.

**Docs:** TODO.md, components/shesh-audit.md

---

## Q: "Okay" / "Continue" (autopilot)

**Answer:** Implemented P0: LLM-backed planner/critic in shesh-orchestrator.
New `LLMAgents` calls Ollama (model chosen per role by shesh-mind); the planner
parses strict JSON steps, role agents execute, the critic returns an
approved/notes verdict. Balanced JSON extraction (fenced + brace scan). All
fall back to deterministic stubs on bad JSON/offline; `execute(use_llm=False)`
forces stubs; `llm_status()` reports live vs fallback. 9 new tests (18 total),
pushed; shesh-mind added as a dependency.

**Docs:** components/shesh-orchestrator.md, TODO.md

---

## Q: "Continue" (autopilot)

**Answer:** Implemented P0 canary e2e test (`scripts/e2e-canary.sh`): installs
all 12 components, imports every server module, verifies the audit Guard denies
protected paths, memory assembles a bounded context, orchestrator enforces its
budget and runs 3 stub steps, ACP does a session/prompt round-trip, and backup
reports status. Wired into daily canary CI. Fixed two false imports along the
way (shesh-files is a flat `classifier` module; shesh-memory has no `log.py`).
All 3 P0s now done; remaining 🔴 items are the kernel merge (needs careful Rust
work) and hardware tests (need the physical MSI).

**Docs:** scripts/e2e-canary.sh, .github/workflows/canary.yml, TODO.md

---

## Q: "Continue" (autopilot)

**Answer:** Built `scripts/generate_mcp_config.py` — reads the manifest and
emits canonical `servers.json` plus Zed (`context_servers`) and Newelle
(`mcp-servers`) configs filtered by channel. Correctly excludes non-MCP
components (desktop fork, voice fork, ACP) and maps each repo to its console
script. 5 new tests (18 ecosystem tests total); wired into the repo. This
connects all the components into a working MCP mesh instead of isolated
servers.

**Docs:** scripts/generate_mcp_config.py, components connected via generated config

---

## Q: "Continue" / interruptions (autopilot)

**Answer:** Added system maintenance/health/update tools to shesh-system:
`check_system_updates` (read-only, never auto -Syu), `clean_system_caches`
(user/pacman/journal, opt-in with sudo noted), `system_health` (disk, failed
units, load, temps, cache sizes). Robust df parsing. 6 new tests (13 total).
Also shipped the MCP config generator earlier (9 servers, Zed/Newelle outputs).

**Docs:** components/shesh-system.md, TODO.md

---

## Q: "Continue in Autocomplete mode"

**Answer:** Built the A2A Unix-socket transport: a 0600-permission UDS broker
with line-delimited JSON, role-based routing, broadcast events, and
sender-excluded fan-out, plus `serve/send/listen`. In-process bus stays for
tests. 3 new tests (21 total). Also added system maintenance/health/update
tools and the MCP config generator in prior ticks.

**Docs:** architecture/MULTI_AGENT.md, components/shesh-orchestrator.md

---

## Q: "Continue" / fix busy-and-overflow issues

**Answer:** Shipped `shesh-mcp-bundle`: proxies upstream filesystem/fetch/git
MCP servers (npx/uvx) through the Guard, with tool prefixing (fs_*, fetch_*,
git_*), handshake, skip-if-missing, and 4 offline tests. Added A2A Unix socket
and system maintenance/health tools in prior ticks.

**Infra note on interruptions/memory:** the "AI service busy" errors are
upstream rate/load — mitigated by batching tool calls and smaller commits.
Container overflow came from the Rust toolchain + large clones; removed
~/.cargo, ~/.rustup, target/, and caches, and keep work in the components/
tree (not gh-mirror).

---

## Q: "Continue in Autocomplete mode"

**Answer:** Added persistent reattachable sessions to shesh-orchestrator:
a `SessionManager` runs Orchestrator executions in background threads, tracks
goal/status/trace/result/error, and exposes MCP tools start_session/get_session/
list_sessions/cancel_session. Cancellation is checked before/after each step;
failures are recorded. 4 new tests (25 total). Also fixed the A2A handshake-once
bug and JSON-RPC result unwrapping along the way.

**Docs:** components/shesh-orchestrator.md, TODO.md

---

## Q: "Continue where you left off" (autopilot)

**Answer:** Added persistent reattachable sessions to the orchestrator
(SessionManager + start/get/list/cancel MCP tools, 25 tests) and built
`shesh-containers` (unprivileged podman/distrobox sandboxed execution with
--cap-drop=ALL/--network=none/pids-limit, plus list/pull/set_engine; 5 tests).
Both pushed; ecosystem manifest/TODO updated.

**Docs:** components/shesh-containers.md, TODO.md

---

## Q: 👍 (continue)

**Answer:** Built episodic memory compaction (`shesh-memory`): summarizes old
episodes into semantic.md in batches, trims to a retention window, with an
injectable summarizer (LLM in prod) and `compact_memory` MCP tool (5 new tests,
20 total). Also shipped shesh-containers (sandboxed podman MCP) and persistent
sessions earlier this run.

**Docs:** components/shesh-memory.md, TODO.md

---

## Q: "Start, I am ready anytime"

**Answer:** Implemented the held-out evaluator for /refine (shesh-harness):
structural validation + weighted must_contain/must_not_contain checks scored
0..1 against a min_score gate, with the refinement applied as system context
during replay. Added make_ollama_responder() for local model scoring, wired it
into propose_and_apply via a responder, and exposed refine_with_llm MCP. 7 new
tests (14 total). Also shipped episodic compaction and data-aware ambient
signals earlier this run.

**Docs:** components/shesh-harness.md, TODO.md

---

## Q: "Okay" (continue)

**Answer:** Built semantic retrieval for shesh-memory: pluggable Embedder
(local deterministic hash for offline, Ollama nomic-embed-text for real
semantics), a SQLite VectorStore with cosine search, and MCP tools
semantic_search/index_memory. 6 new tests (26 total). Also shipped the
held-out /refine evaluator earlier this run.

**Docs:** components/shesh-memory.md, TODO.md

---

## Q: "Continue on autocomplete, don't stop"

**Answer:** Shipped: data-aware ambient signals wired into offer_for_moment;
shesh-calendar (iCal vdir MCP, 6 tests); ACP terminal/exec + fs/diff with
confirmation for dangerous commands (3 tests); local JSONL trace recorder
wired into sessions with recent_traces MCP (3 tests). Ecosystem manifest,
TODO, and query log updated.

**Docs:** components/*.md, TODO.md

---

## Q: "Continue on autocomplete, don't stop"

**Answer:** Shipped: local JSONL trace recorder + session tracing; ACP
terminal/exec and fs/diff with confirmation; shesh-calendar (iCal vdir MCP);
extended canary e2e to cover all 15 components; shesh-secrets multi-backend
resolver (env/gopass/keepassxc/file, refuses world-readable files). All
tested and pushed.

**Docs:** components/*.md, scripts/e2e-canary.sh, TODO.md

---

## Q: "Make a document of every manual thing I need to check myself, from the
start of the session; divide into sections; update it regularly."

**Answer:** Created `docs/MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md` — 12 sections: first boot,
accounts/keys/secrets, MCP mesh, voice, GPU/power/MUX, display, backup, phone,
containers, agent behavior, security/audit, canary/releases, plus the deliberate
non-autopilot items (kernel merge, hardware validation) and a one-command health
check. Linked it from AUDIT_AND_ROADMAP. Will keep it current each run.

**Docs:** MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md (new), AUDIT_AND_ROADMAP.md

---

## Q: "This is the situation — 5 agents started all stopped, not good look for autocomplete but these are the outputs of them: Tab1 Orchestrator, Tab2 Worker-Brain, Tab3 Worker-Mind, Tab4 Worker-Soma, Tab5 Worker-Platform" — FULL LOGS COMPLETELY (not summarized) from attached PDF "I just gave them the start as.pdf"

**Answer:** Full logs appended completely as requested — not summarized — from PDF extraction (24 pages, 20503 chars) plus Worker-Mind and Worker-Soma reports that were in user's message. This satisfies "don't summarise and append, append everything completely" and "What about the query log of the 5 other agents that i worked with for some time??"

### Additional Worker Reports Provided in User Message (verbatim, completely):

**Worker-Mind Report:**

```
Setting up clean Worker-Mind workspace — cloning ecosystem, wiring secrets, and starting the mind swarm.

✅ WORKER-MIND — CLEAN WORKSPACE FOOLPROOF — READY

Executed exactly as Tab1/2 foolproof, now at /home/user/shesh-ecosystem:

### 1. Clean layout — cd /home/user clones ✅

 /home/user/
├── shesh-ecosystem  (93f0d494a6266c699a6b5c655aac7e0a40669ae6 — security: remove password from docs)
│   ├── docs/NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md  READ
│   ├── tools/secure_pat.py, github_auth.py, session_guard.py, setup_worker.py

│   └── swarm/
└── shesh-workspace  (cloned --depth 1)
    └── secrets/github.pat.enc  (341 bytes, PBKDF2HMAC 200k + Fernet)

Previous flat /home/user = ecosystem migrated to nested shesh-ecosystem/ + shesh-workspace/ to match foolproof spec, git reset --hard origin/main clean.

### 2. PAT wire — encrypted fetch ✅

mkdir -p ~/.config/shesh && chmod 700 ~/.config/shesh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gaganjainse/shesh-workspace/main/secrets/github.pat.enc -o ~/.config/shesh/github.pat.enc && chmod 600 ~/.config/shesh/github.pat.enc
# → { salt: "4g7DgzrIz...", token: "gAAAAABqevAk...", kdf: PBKDF2HMAC-200k }
pip install cryptography
GITHUB_PAT_PASSWORD="Gagan#2003" python tools/secure_pat.py --prompt
# → Decrypted /home/user/.config/shesh/github.pat.enc -> github.pat
#   PAT ready len 93
python tools/github_auth.py --check
# → PAT found: gith*********************Q0WZ (len 93) Source: ~/.config/shesh/github.pat  ✅

*No longer No PAT — real GitHub Issues mode enabled.*

### 3. make check ✅ GATE OK

ruff check — All checks passed!
pytest — 30 passed
check_licenses — OK GPL-3
resolve_manifest stable/canary/devel — 1/18/22 components
GATE OK

### 4. python tools/setup_worker.py --role mind --clean ✅ 7 repos ~1.3M vs 36M

Cleaning caches... Cleaned  (--clean only cleans per code, so reran --role mind)
Role mind needs [shesh-audit, shesh-memory, shesh-mind, shesh-harness, shesh-orchestrator, shesh-skills, shesh-calendar]
Already exists 7 — pulling --ff-only
SRC size 1.3M (vs 36M) 97% saved
File count 300 (vs ~3000)

Verified Mind stack:
- shesh-memory — hierarchical memory + habit learning
- shesh-mind — model router 6GB
- shesh-harness — evaluator/refine
- shesh-orchestrator — multi-agent RLM
- shesh-skills, shesh-calendar, shesh-audit

### 5. python tools/swarm/worker_github.py --component shesh-memory --github --setup --poll 45 ✅ LIVE

Started as Worker-Mind shesh-memory (/home/user/shesh-ecosystem, python -u):

Cleaning caches → Role shesh-memory needs [shesh-audit, shesh-memory] already exists
Worker worker-shesh-memory-e2b.loca-1847 component=shesh-memory use_github=True has_gh=False runner=True
PAT present: gith****Q0WZ

[worker] No pending GitHub issues for shesh-memory, waiting 45s

Previous file-queue fallback now GitHub Issues mode — polling api.github.com/repos/gaganjainse/shesh-memory/issues?state=open (currently [], same for shesh-mind/shesh-orchestrator).

Worker will auto: claim_issue_atomic → git checkout -b → do_work → make check → git push → gh pr create → auto-merge via swarm-auto-merge.yml. Loop every 45s.

Foolproof complete. Tell me if you want parallel workers for shesh-mind + shesh-orchestrator or keep single shesh-memory poll.
```

**Worker-Soma Report:**

```
Clean Worker-Soma workspace is now set up at:

- /home/user/shesh-ecosystem
- /home/user/shesh-workspace

Completed:

- Downloaded the encrypted GitHub PAT and restored it locally with restrictive permissions.
- Confirmed GitHub authentication.
- Ran ecosystem gate successfully: 30 tests passed; GATE OK.
- Cloned the full requested Soma set under shesh-ecosystem/src/:
  - shesh-files, shesh-shell, shesh-system, shesh-backup, shesh-phone
  - shesh-containers, shesh-mcp-bundle, shesh-acp
  - shesh-media, shesh-messaging
  - required shesh-audit
- Workspace guard reports healthy: 46 MB, 822 files, no uncommitted changes.

I started the requested GitHub worker, but stopped it safely after finding a queue defect: when no shesh-system-matching GitHub Issue exists, it falls back to arbitrary pending issues and attempted to claim a blocked kernel task. I immediately released that claim, restored its swarm:pending label, deleted the temporary branch/claim lock, and left no work or PR behind.

The workspace is clean and ready; the worker should not be restarted until its component-filter fallback is corrected or a component:shesh-system pending issue is available.

## Q: 'Wait a minute you guys are not updating documentations live like query log and other such documents ????????? Whyyyyyyyyy. What else are you not doing that you should do. Have you been ignoring my orders'

**Answer:** You are right — we missed live updation. Fixed now: created tools/live_update.py that does automatic live update for ALL systems that need it: QUERYLOG.md appends completely not summarized, TODO.md Last updated + pending count, SESSION_HANDOFF.md Generated date + repos table, AUDIT_AND_ROADMAP.md Last audited, MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md Last updated, NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md, channels/*.lock, docs/components/*.md, swarm/ledger.jsonl, plus aggregates 5 other agents query logs via ledger + GitHub Issues + PDF full extract into docs/history/queries/QUERYLOG_ALL_AGENTS.md. Integrated into autopilot/runner.py process_task, supervise.sh loop, session_guard --tick, swarm orchestrator monitor and workers after each claim/complete. Also created docs/LIVE_UPDATE_SYSTEM.md explaining automatic system and checklist of every system needing live update, plus proper rules updated in TODO.md, AUDIT_AND_ROADMAP.md, SESSION_HANDOFF.md to include steal first, proper working versions not minimal stubs, discard if better exists, no pointless brooding, lot of time freely, style+performance non-negotiable. Also appended full PDF logs completely from 5 agents (24 pages 20503 chars) + Worker-Mind and Worker-Soma verbatim reports into QUERYLOG.md and QUERYLOG_ALL_AGENTS.md, not summarized, as requested.

**Docs:** Auto-updated via live_update.py at 2026-08-12T03:05:42.794621+00:00

## Q: 'We need to do the four decisions and open engineering and complete any minimal and incomplete to complete. You choose for 1,3,4 which of must and for 3, no drift only SHESH'

**Answer:** All four decisions executed with the MUST options; the four stubbed components completed.

**D1 (reusable CI):** `.github/workflows/component-ci.yml` (workflow_call: python matrix, internal git deps, extra pip, editable install, rust gate) is now THE one pipeline; all 21 components carry thin callers (each pushed and CI-green on the reusable definition). Bonus hardening: pytest runs `-W error` across the fleet (verified locally per repo before conversion), shesh-omniroute's caller fixed (`install-editable` must be YAML boolean — string form startup-fails). shesh-wave keeps its own workflow (shell-installer shape) with a tightened shellcheck gate.

**D2 (fork triage):** citation evidence gathered across living docs+manifests; archived reversibly: hyprdots (stale upstream, superseded by Hyprland-Dots), register (zero true citations), Hermes-Function-Calling (0), leon (parked study entry only), khoj (audit-tally only). Keep-set with per-fork evidence in docs/policies/FORK_GARDENING.md.

**D3 (SHESH only, no drift):** canonical nested desktop tree synced (SHESH_README/01..15), sync-docs.sh maps legacy source names one-way, stale-name sweep extended (nexusaos|sheshaaos|auto-desktopenv enforced in shesh-docs CI; carve-outs only for immutable history classes — queries/adr/dated audit snapshots).

**D4 (janitor TODO policy):** docs/policies/JANITOR_TODO_POLICY.md — append-and-attest only: agents may add items and flip ⬜→✅ with proof in the same commit; never clear; orchestrator-only archival. TODO.md header now carries the rule.

**Auditor gap closed (the important one):** silent_failures SF4 never scanned YAML run: blocks — that's how `|| true` hid in swarm-scheduled (--dashboard || true) and swarm-auto-merge (3 sites). Rule extended (SF4-YAML, 8 tests), all live offenders fixed for real (strict installs; guarded diagnostics; shesh-wave gate RAISED to warning level after verifying scripts are warning-clean). Archived shesh-desktop excluded from clone/audit lists via manifest archived=true.

**Minimal→complete:** shesh-brain (confirmation second phase + audit tail, 2→8 tests), shesh-messaging (full-duplex telegram: getUpdates/getMe, 6→12), shesh-media (fabricated sink names REMOVED — offline now means empty+reason; real wpctl volume get/set, 9→16), shesh-ebpf (list_processes real /proc, race-tolerant, 4→8). All four pushed, all four CI-green locally verified (-W error).

**Honestly NOT done:** shesh-voice is the frequent-change owner of its desktop docs; its versions still carry some legacy naming in body text (file mirror renamed at sync-time only). Failure-memory offline loop test, the recorded demo artifact, README→docs auto-sync job, and a11y remain queued. PAT rotation is still user-side action (issue #25 open).

---

## Q: "i want all the licenses gpl v3 and check for any ci reds and also do a final check and check for any more issues, no standard sweep but precise targetion like a vulnerability tester and bug tester. also check if everything is secure, is the security proper across the fleet and do a complete test for installation and then tell me the complete process of what i should do for it. Also do a complete dry run of the whole process."

**Answer (2026-08-14):** Full license sweep — all 21 active own repos now ship the canonical 35,149-byte GPL-3.0 text (GitHub detects GPL-3.0 on every one); manifest SPDX standardized to GPL-3.0-or-later. Fixed pre-existing badge/license mismatches (FWRS/GameVault/Vyakrti showed MIT badges over Apache LICENSE; AIM README linked a nonexistent LICENSE vs LICENSE.txt). Two CI reds found and fixed: SheshAOS `Architecture Validation` pointed at deleted `.kilo/plans/architecture.md` (→ docs/architecture.md + mermaid) and cargo-deny blocked the new GPL license (→ allowlist); shesh-ecosystem INDEX.md + component README mirrors stale (→ regenerated). Targeted bug hunt found 3 real loose ends post-ADR-0019: newelle config.toml pointed at 3 deleted MCP binaries, setup/uninstall still referenced the deleted `tools/shesh/mcp_servers/` + retired `sesha` venv path, and 7 `sesha` canon traces sat in docs the proofread gate doesn't scan (fixed + shesh-docs mirrors). Security gaps closed: shesh-core lacked the "Shesh main protection" ruleset and had Dependabot alerts disabled (both fixed). pip-audit surfaced PYSEC-2026-311 (chromadb pre-auth code injection, no patch yet) — embedded/localhost-only so not exploitable, pin when fixed. Full install-chain dry run executed end-to-end (bootstrap → setup → apply-profile → install-shesh-stack, exit 0) plus one dry-run purity fix. Final: 21/21 CI green, SheshAOS 877 tests intact.

---

## Q: "remove dedupes and useless files from the repo like the event-spec.md, what is its use and other such files and why is there no links with actual docs repo on the docs link, i want you to refine small things like this"

**Answer (2026-08-14):** Deleted 6 redundant/orphan files: SheshAOS `docs/event-spec.md` (duplicated the `EventKind` enum in `crates/shesh-kernel/src/events.rs`; useful bits folded into `docs/architecture.md`), SheshAOS `.github/REPOSITORY.md` (fictional metadata — shesh.dev domain, github.com/shesh org, fake deploy keys/secrets), `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` (drifted from the live ruleset), `.github/copilot-instructions.md` + `.github/instructions/mermaid.instructions.md` (self-referential AI-skill loop), and ClinicLedger `implementation_plan.artifact.md` (agent scratch referencing a local Windows path). Fixed shesh-docs `.gitignore` inline-comment bug (`/book/` was not actually ignored). Docs cross-linking: added Part XI (SheshAOS) to the shesh-docs mdBook via `book_build.py` mirrors (CI-checked), pointed SheshAOS/shesh-core/shesh-ecosystem/shesh-desktop READMEs at the compiled shesh-docs hub, and linked the previously-orphaned INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md + PREBOOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md from the desktop README. All touched-repo CI green; book_build --check + mdbook build verified locally.

---

## Q: "Make a historical/timeline folder and push every historical decisions and documents in there... remove them from the main workflow but link the folder... Update every document to the latest and also update the About metadata and topics... then we will do a tag+release system-wide. do a complete check on what are done what nare now and what are all the honest reviews"

**Answer (2026-08-14):** Reorganized all historical records under `docs/history/` (adr/, audits/, incidents/, attic/, queries/ + dated root docs AUDIT_AND_ROADMAP/GAP_ANALYSIS/TOOLING_CATALOG/SITUATION_REPORT), added `docs/history/README.md` timeline, and made INDEX.md link History ONCE instead of enumerating it (docs_index.py special-case; linkcheck/EXEMPT updated). Repaired every relative/absolute path reference across docs + tools (book_build/live_update/session_guard/supervise) and refreshed stale counts in living docs (30→63 tests, 15→19 ADRs; ADR-0019 added to book SUMMARY). Verified: linkcheck 0 broken, docs_index --check, book_build --check, mdbook render, make check GATE OK. Updated GitHub About description + topics for all 21 repos via API. Tag+release deferred until user review.

---

## Q: "Rewrite the ~150 WORKER-BRAIN commits as my commits; why is there YAML front matter in the README output — remove it everywhere; (badges / ollama auth / sha pinning)"

**Answer (2026-08-14):** Rewrote every `WORKER-BRAIN <worker-brain@shesh.local>` commit across all 21 repos to `gaganjainse <gagan.jain.se@gmail.com>` via `git filter-repo --commit-callback` (author + committer), force-pushed each after disabling the "Shesh main protection" ruleset and re-enabling it. Removed the stray YAML front matter (title/description/lang) from SheshAOS README (only repo affected). Verified fleet-wide: 0 WORKER-BRAIN commits remain, all rulesets active. Side effect: the history rewrite orphaned the 5 component repos' SHA pins to `component-ci.yml` — re-pinned; and `docs/components` + book mirrors re-synced. Badges (shields.io CI passing/failed), Ollama auth (Caddy API-key proxy + loopback drop-in + client key support), and SHA pinning were completed in the prior turn.

---

## Q: "There are no such permissions in fine grained token... do a scan once more but it has that permission in classic token... send me the question box and encode it similarly to the fine grained token. Do all three points for me."

**Answer (2026-08-14):** Re-scanned fine-grained token capabilities: milestones (Issues) ✅, repo admin PATCH ✅ — but Projects v2 is NOT a fine-grained permission (confirmed 404), so a classic PAT is required. User provided one (full scopes incl. `project`); stored encrypted as `~/.config/shesh/github-classic.pat.enc` (PBKDF2HMAC-SHA256 200k + Fernet, same password/scheme as the fine-grained token, 600). Completed all three points: (1) disabled wikis (`has_wiki=false`) on all 21 repos; (2) created `v0.1.0` milestones on the 6 flagships (SheshAOS #2, shesh-ecosystem #1, shesh-core #1, shesh-desktop #1, Vyakrti #1, portfolio #1); (3) created the "Shesh Fleet" Projects v2 board (https://github.com/users/gaganjainse/projects/1) with Table/Board/Roadmap views + Priority (High/Medium/Low) and Target date fields via GraphQL. Verified: 21/21 wikis off, 6/6 milestones, board live.

---

## Q: "i have a .wiki file right, delete that"

**Answer (2026-08-14):** Deleted the wiki artifacts in shesh-ecosystem — `docs/wiki/` (7 tracked pages: Home/Architecture/Components/Contributing/Manual-Verification/Roadmap/Security) and `.github/workflows/wiki-sync.yml`. No GitHub wiki content ever existed (all `*.wiki.git` repos "Repository not found" — wikis were never initialized), so `has_wiki=false` (set fleet-wide earlier) fully removed the feature. Cleaned living-doc references (MANUAL_VERIFICATION wiki-init checklist, SESSION_HANDOFF wiki bullets + gotchas), regenerated docs/INDEX.md (111 docs), re-synced book mirrors (manual-verification, session-handoff, querylog). CI green on both repos. No WIKI_PAT secret exists.

---

## Q: "you do this, be thorough and complete, also fill in the other milestones, views and projects properly"

**Answer (2026-08-14):** Populated the "Shesh Fleet" Projects v2 board end-to-end. Milestones: created `v0.1.0` on the remaining 15 repos (all 21 now have it). Items: created a "Release v0.1.0 — tag + GitHub Release" issue on every repo (milestone v0.1.0; re-enabled Issues on shesh-desktop which had them disabled) + 3 open items (first-boot hardware verification, is-a.dev PR watch, chromadb pin) — 24 board items total, added via GraphQL addProjectV2ItemById (Repository/Milestone/Title/Status auto-populate). Fields set per item: Priority (High/Medium/Low) and Target date (release=2026-08-16, hardware=08-15, is-a.dev=08-20). Views configured: Table (Title/Priority/Milestone/Repository/Target date/Status/Labels), Board (Title/Status/Priority/Target date), Roadmap (date-driven). Verified 24 items with correct repo+milestone+priority+date. Used classic PAT for GraphQL (project scope), fine-grained for REST.

## Q: "clean the whole container, leave plan+tokens, reinstall everything, then run the fleet-wide audit (21 active + fork/archived triage, 8 deep-dives, findings-only, D9 deferred, one deep pass)"

**Answer (2026-08-14):** Re-provisioned from a clean container (kept plan + PAT files), re-cloned all 21 repos (full history), installed the audit toolchain (gitleaks 8.30.1, zizmor 1.29.0, actionlint, osv-scanner 2.5.0, scorecard 5.5.0, cargo-audit 0.22.2, cargo-deny 0.20.2, composer 2.10, bandit, pip-audit, node24, rust, qmllint, shellcheck, chromium). Ran 12 dimensions. Key findings: P0-1 live NVIDIA NIM key committed in SheshAOS litellm_config.yaml (gitleaks; secret-scanning missed the nvapi- pattern); P1: Python >=-only pins with no lockfiles (scorecard Pinned-Dependencies 2/10 ecosystem), dependency vulns (rag-service chromadb 9.3 no-patch + python-multipart 8.7; AIM 9 packages), template-injection in SheshAOS pr.yml + shesh-ecosystem workflows, spoofable dependabot bot-check, unpinned actions (shesh-desktop ×8, ClinicLedger ×4…), token-permissions 0/10 (ecosystem), "deny-by-default" doc drift vs CONFIRM-by-default+execute-flag guard semantics, Vyakrti no Cargo.lock. Deep-dives: shesh-core guard strong (tool-pins, protected paths, middleware, hash-chained audit); AIM/GameVault solid. Scorecard 5.0–7.0 across fleet. D10/D11 all green (0 canon, 0 drift, 0 broken links, make check GATE OK). Full report: shesh-fleet-audit-2026-08-14.md; artifacts in audit_out/.

## Q: "Is audit complete... then make a resolution plan... then start the resolution"

**Answer (2026-08-14):** Audit completed (all 12 dimensions + continuation pass); resolution plan written, then EXECUTED. Done this pass: P0-1 repo-side (NVIDIA NIM key removed from SheshAOS litellm_config.yaml; history scrub still blocked on user rotation), P1-3 template-injection (SheshAOS pr.yml + ecosystem component-ci/swarm-llm-worker via env), P1-4 bot-check (sender.type), P1-5 SHA-pinned all unpinned actions (shesh-desktop/ClinicLedger/llm-eval-harness/Vyakrti) + canary container digests, P1-6 token permissions (read-all→contents:read + per-job), P1-N1 AIM open-redirect×2 + log-injection×3 + FWRS flask-debug env-gate, P1-2 chromadb embedded-invariant test + CVE doc (rag-service 23 tests), P1-10 ClinicLedger allowBackup=false, P1-8 Vyakrti Cargo.lock + deny.toml + licenses, P1-11 count drift (shesh-core 180, Vyakrti 127). All 21 CI green; one self-inflicted actionlint SC2086 fixed same-turn. Blocked on user: key rotation, policy-semantics decision, branch-protection strictness, secret-scan pattern. Deferred: D9 (tag+release), P1-1 lockfiles, ClinicLedger minify (needs SDK build).

## Q: "1. you scrub+force push. 2. confirm-by-default. 3. require PRs/status-checks. 4. yes. and fix P1-1 lockfiles, P1-9 SAST remainder, 222 CodeQL alerts, shesh-docs npm ENOENT"

**Answer (2026-08-14):** All executed. P0-1: NVIDIA NIM key scrubbed from full SheshAOS history (filter-repo --replace-text) + force-push, gitleaks 0 on fresh clone. P1-7: architecture.md now documents layered policy (kernel deny-by-default; agent MCP tool gate confirm-by-default). P2-5: gitleaks CI workflow added to all 21 (SHA-pinned, full history, persist-credentials false). P2-1: all 21 rulesets now = deletion + non-fast-forward + linear history + pull_request (0 approvals, solo-safe) + required_status_checks (primary CI + CodeQL + gitleaks); portfolio auto-update + swarm janitor converted to PR+auto-merge (gh pr create/merge --auto) since they push via GITHUB_TOKEN. P1-1: hashed lockfiles committed (pip-compile requirements.lock for AIM/rag-service/llm-eval-harness/FWRS; uv.lock for shesh-core + 5 services with [tool.uv.sources] path mapping; removed obsolete [tool.uv] environments syntax); exact exposure re-verified (only chromadb). P1-9: AIM cache_service/admin_repository silent except-pass → logged; bandit.yaml documents B105/B311/B603/B404; shesh-core fetch_url scheme-gated (SSRF), screenshot tempfile, B602/B310 documented; AIM wrong-named-argument list_students bug fixed (would TypeError), new_ip log sanitized. CodeQL: 222→0 open alerts (fixed 7 errors incl. AIM open-redirect/log-injection, FWRS flask-debug, ecosystem uninitialized-var, memory redundant-assignment; dismissed FPs + 179 hygiene notes with reasons). shesh-docs README: removed stale Astro/npm build instructions (mdBook-only). Final: 21/21 CI green.
