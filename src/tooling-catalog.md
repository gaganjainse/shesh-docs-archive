# Tooling & Skills Catalog

> **Historical record.** This document describes the state of the system at the time it was written and is retained for provenance. It is not maintained and may contradict current behaviour. For current documentation, see the [reference section](index.md).

> What turns Shesh from a demo into a full ecosystem. We **build** the Shesh-specific organs
> (system, shell, files, skills) and **package** the best mature open-source MCP servers for the
> rest — pinning versions, wrapping them in our policy/audit layer. **Our job is not just to fork and wrap, but to upgrade the wrapper for our needs and customize and specialize it for our CachyOS/Hyprland/6GB VRAM system and improve it** — e.g., Newelle fork stripped GNOME-only assumptions, added Hyprland Quickshell overlay, prewired our MCP servers, set 6GB-safe model defaults, renamed in about-screen to "Shesh (Newelle core)" — that's upgrade, not just wrap.
>
> We are integrating various different systems (Hyprland + Quickshell + MCP + voice + eBPF + containers + phone ADB), but there should be no conflict between them. We have to be cautious but enterprising — namespace via MCP stdio process boundaries (never in-process FFI), Guard policy allow/confirm/deny, separate systemd user services, separate config dirs `~/.config/shesh/mcp/`, separate btrfs subvolumes, so integrations don't clash. Principle: **one job per component, one process per MCP server, one policy gate**.

> We only want **open-source things** — MIT/Apache-2.0/GPL-3.0, truly free, no API key, no subscription, self-hostable, offline-first. No online-led subscription like Tavily (paid per query, $0.005/query, needs API key, not open-source). Use self-hosted open alternatives: SearXNG (AGPL-3.0, self-hosted metasearch 70+ engines, no key, fully private), agent-search (MIT, bundles SearXNG, zero keys, one-command deploy, MCP server for AI agents, Tor option), DuckDuckGo MCP (truly free, no key, privacy-first).

## Organs we build (already in the ecosystem)
| Component | Repo | Provides |
|---|---|---|
| shesh-system | gaganjainse/shesh-system | power/GPU/MUX/backup, system status |
| shesh-shell | gaganjainse/shesh-shell | Hyprland/Quickshell control |
| shesh-files | gaganjainse/shesh-files | real-time organizer (Rust+Python) |
| shesh-skills | gaganjainse/shesh-skills | notes, web, git, docs, reminders + skill library |
| shesh-voice | (fork of Newelle) | STT/TTS/wake word, chat UI |
| shesh-audit/brain/mind/memory/phone | planned | governance, routing, RAG, ADB |

## Mature MCP servers we package (do NOT rebuild)
Pin each in a component repo; run as a stdio MCP server behind the Shesh policy.

| Need | Recommended server | License | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Local filesystem | **@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem** (Anthropic) | MIT | Scoped, read/write controls; we point it only at allowed dirs |
| Git operations | **server-git** (Anthropic) | MIT | status/diff/log without shelling out |
| Web fetch | **mcp-server-fetch** (Anthropic) | MIT | Safe URL→markdown fetch (use alongside our fetch_url) |
| Sequential reasoning | **server-sequential-thinking** | MIT | Complex multi-step problem solving |
| Memory | **server-memory** (knowledge graph) | MIT | Persistent entity/relation memory |
| Browser automation | **Playwright MCP** (Microsoft) | Apache-2.0 | Real browser for JS sites/testing; runs sandboxed |
| GitHub | **github-mcp-server** | MIT | Issues/PRs/CI using your PAT (read-only by default) |
| SQLite | **server-sqlite** | MIT | Local analytics/history DBs |
| Time/calendar | **server-time** | MIT | Timezone-aware scheduling |
| Docs (PDF/Office) | **markitdown-mcp** (Microsoft) | MIT | Convert PDF/DOCX/XLSX→markdown |
| Browser devtools | **chrome-devtools-mcp** | Apache-2.0 | Web dev/debugging |
| Search (self-hosted, open-source) | **SearXNG** (AGPL-3.0, self-hosted metasearch 70+ engines, no key, fully private) + **agent-search** (MIT, bundles SearXNG, zero keys, one-command `docker compose up`, MCP server for AI agents, Tor option) + **DuckDuckGo MCP** (truly free, no key, privacy-first) | AGPL-3.0 / MIT | No API key, no subscription, self-hosted, offline-first — replaces Tavily (closed-source, $0.005/query, needs API key, online-led, not open-source). We discarded Tavily per user request: only open-source things. |

All are stdio and lockfile-pinned via `uvx`/`npx`. We never run an MCP server with broader
filesystem/shell access than its task needs (principle of least privilege + our policy engine).

## Skills library (Markdown, in shesh-skills/skills)
Shipped: `coding`, `web-research`, `docs-writer`, `safety-governance`, `daily-briefing`.

To add next (each is a small Markdown file + optional tool wiring):

- **email-messaging** — read/send via local client/CLI (e.g., `neomutt`/`thunderbird` API), never store passwords.
- **calendar** — CalDAV (`vdirsyncer` + `khal`) for local-first scheduling.
- **terminal-ops** — safe shell patterns over SSH (wraps shesh-terminal patterns).
- **container-ops** — podman/distrobox control (build/run/list) for sandboxed tasks.
- **kernel-tuning** — eBPF/telemetry queries (research track), read-only by default.
- **media** — screenshots, screen recording, wallpaper, audio routing.
- **job-mode** — isolated profile: work git identity, no personal cloud, different theme.
- **writing** — long-form editing with markdown/pdf export.
- **finance** — parse bills/invoices into `~/Documents/Personal/Finance`.
- **language** — Vyākṛti integration; translation/sanskrit tooling.

## What we deliberately avoid (for now)
- **Hosted SaaS MCPs** (Notion, Slack, Linear, Stripe) until the cloud tier is explicitly opted in
  and audited; local-first is the default.
- **Arbitrary shell-execution MCPs** ("run any command") — we use scoped servers + policy instead.
- **AGPL servers linked into the body** — if needed, run as isolated separate services.
- **Multiple agent runtimes** — Newelle is the host; Goose/Hermes/pi are references, not daemons.

## Promotion
Each third-party server is wrapped in a component repo that:
1. pins the version (`uv.lock`/`package-lock.json`),
2. sets its allowed directories/env in a config under `~/.config/shesh/mcp/`,
3. is registered in `manifests/components.toml`,
4. passes the same lint/test/license gate,
5. runs through `shesh-audit` so every tool call is logged.
