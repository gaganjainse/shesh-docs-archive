# Incident post-mortem — 2026-08-11: five-tab swarm collision

**Status:** mitigated same-day; controls landed in PRs #37, #38, #39, #40.

## What happened

Five parallel agent tabs (orchestrator + brain/mind/soma/platform workers) plus
GitHub Actions drove one swarm bus for a day. Net effect: real bugs got found and
fixed, but also: duplicate/noise issues seeded (#19–34), placeholder "work" PRs
merged to main (5 commits: marker files from a stub `do_work`), claim/PR closure
cross-talk via the shared issue/PR number space, and a PAT exposed in a transcript.

## Root causes (each now has a control)

1. **Worker placebo** — `do_work()` marker-filed every claim and auto-merge
   closed real issues. → Workers now fail closed without `--executor` and release
   claims (`release_issue_claim`) — #39.
2. **Loose TODO seeder** — any line containing ⬜/🟡 became an issue. → Strict
   bullet parser + blocked-ancestor inheritance — #38.
3. **Shared working tree with daemon commits** — heartbeat commits raced manual
   rebases. → daemons isolated to their own clone via `tools/swarm/daemon.sh`;
   orchestrator refuses swarm commits off-main — #40.
4. **Gate gaps** — ruff didn't cover `tools/` locally (29 pre-existing errors);
   workflow used forbidden `gh pr review --approve`. → fixed on main same day
   (45150db5397bd01058c7f5f535c0e54f49eef54c, b2c2182d0990e2a17d49a12933a7c155177ea9a5); local `make check` and CI now match.
5. **Session guard self-nuke** — `--status` past 60 min deleted the plain PAT
   under running daemons. → read-only status; explicit `--handoff` only — #40.
6. **Credential hygiene** — PAT visible in a tool transcript. → rotation task
   opened (owner action), askpass-style auth in workers — #39.

## What was good

- Atomic claim refs, auto-merge gate, heartbeat bus and hop protocol all behaved
  under multi-agent load once the above were fixed. The incident was the best
  stress test the system has had; findings became code the same day.

## Residue

- 5 placeholder commits remain in main's history (no force-push, by policy).
  They are harmless inert markers under `swarm/artifacts/` — content removed in
  c421f32613bd33745b641878338ff1d3436da08f; this note is the institutional memory.

## Appendix A — original situation report (raw evidence, 2026-08-11)

Preserved verbatim (quotes included) when `docs/history/SITUATION_REPORT.md` was
fused into this incident record on 2026-08-13 ("one topic, one home"). Two
findings here extend the root-cause list above: the **queue fallback defect**
(claiming blocked kernel tasks when no matching issue existed — fixed to
strict-filter waiting) and **heartbeat files as the reliable liveness signal**
(buffered stdout of long-running processes is not). The per-tab chronology
below is the source evidence for the post-mortem.

> **User said:** "I just gave them the start as a prompt. Leave that aside the main point is that the five agents I started all stopped, not a good look for a autocomplete but these are the outputs of them"

You attached PDF with outputs from Tab1 Orchestrator, Tab2 Worker-Brain, etc.

### What happened (from PDF)

#### Tab1 Orchestrator — Starting the workers

- Seeded 14 issues from TODO.md ⬜
- Claim protocol already swaps `swarm:pending → swarm:claimed` correctly
- Question: what labels seeder applies — checking cut-off `labels=[` block
- Fix implemented: Creating branch first, then patching labels block needs exact match
- Both files patched, syntax check, gate, commit, rebase, push, PR #36 live https://github.com/gaganjainse/shesh-ecosystem/pull/36 — watching for CI + auto-merge: Clean
- Re-routing through `swarm/`-prefixed branch: Both live
- Verified live — fresh heartbeats from both monitor and worker (14:23), plus third from `worker-shesh-audit` (another agent active) — multi-agent swarm genuinely running
- **Work delivered PR #37 → merged `fb2fc03614c44b9320577f21b695e200d0c78a18`, closes #31:** Found weakest link and fixed it, dogfooding full pipeline

#### Weakest link found and fixed (dogfooding)

1. **`do_work()` was placeholder** — marker-filed every claim and let auto-merge silently close real TODOs without doing them. Now worker **refuses without implementer and releases claim back to `swarm:pending`** (drops lock ref + work branch + labels + reason comment). Placeholder kept behind explicit `--simulate`
2. **PAT fingerprint removed** from worker logs (length only)
3. **`ensure_label()`** before issue creation → seeding can never 422 on missing labels
4. `HAS_RUNNER` now honestly reflects autopilot import
- Merged by `github-actions[bot]` through real swarm gate (ruff `scripts/+tools/`, pytest, license gate) — first attempt #36 taught gate only accepts `swarm/*` branches, so #37 came from `swarm/agent/worker-safe-auth`
- **Queue housekeeping:** Closed 11 duplicate issues #19–#30 from stale re-seed, commented + `swarm:duplicate` and #29 `swarm:invalid` (was TODO header line). Remaining 14 open issues are all `swarm:claimed`/`swarm:blocked` — shesh-kernel→SheshAOS Rust track correctly blocked here (no cargo)

**Now running in Tab1:**
- Monitor loop pid 4623 ✅ heartbeats → main, stale-claim requeue >10 min
- GitHub worker `general` pid 4692 ✅ polling 45s, queue correctly empty until new `swarm:pending` seeds

**Operational notes for prompt file:**
- Session guard auto-deleted plain PAT at 60-min hop threshold while processes needed it — re-decrypted via password. Don't run `--status` mid-session if you want PAT to survive; it triggers handoff cleanup
- Background committers + manual branch work share one working tree — rebase hit heartbeat commit mid-flight. Future manual work: pause monitor first or use separate clone
- Long-running swarm processes buffer stdout — heartbeat files in `swarm/heartbeats/` are reliable liveness signal, not logs

#### Tab2 Worker-Brain — Clean workspace boot

- Fresh clean-workspace boot with PAT retrieved from `shesh-workspace` (no pasting needed)
- Stopped old worker from previous turn and verified encrypted PAT fetchable: encrypted PAT live at `shesh-workspace/secrets/github.pat.enc` (valid PBKDF2/Fernet)
- Wiped old layout and cloned both repos
- PAT config dir + encrypted file: `cryptography` and `ruff` didn't survive snapshot (pytest did). Installing them, then decrypting PAT: ✅ PAT decrypted 93 chars fine-grained, plain file at `0600`, never echoed
- Auth check + quality gate: **GATE OK** ✅ — PAT loaded redacted, 30/30 tests pass, locks resolved
- `setup_worker --role brain --clean` — tool's `--clean` flag short-circuits to cache-cleaning only, so ran twice: exact command from sequence, then actual clone: 3 brain repos cloned — **3.3 MB/305 files** (blob-filtered shallow clones vs 36 MB for all 22)
- Starting swarm worker with full auth: worker is live and claiming issues — found queue populated this time. Verify poll loop continues

#### Tab2 continued — PR failures

- Worker claiming issues and pushing branches, but **every PR fails with 422 "No commits between main and branch"** — placeholder work never gets committed
- Found: 4 claim refs and 4 branches exist (two claimed by another live agent `worker-general-…` — swarm genuinely multi-agent). PR failures point to missing git identity: `git commit` would fail silently with no `user.name`/`user.email` configured
- Root cause confirmed: commit steps wallows all errors (`|| true`), sandbox has **no git identity** — so `git commit` fails silently, branches push empty (identical to main), GitHub rejects PR with 422
- Fix: set repo-local git identity (running worker will pick it up on next commit), then cleanup two empty branches/claims so issues #5/#16 go back to queue
- Still 422 — commit itself isn't only problem. Branches exist on origin only because `claim_issue_atomic` creates them **via API**; CLI `git push` fails silently (origin URL has no credentials — `|| true` swallows error), so remote branch stays empty. Fix is git credential auth — setup credential helper reading decrypted PAT, then test end-to-end
- Stopped worker before it claims more issues with broken pushes, cleaning up all empty claims/branches and restoring issues to pending: script bug — wrong index in branch-name parse, fixing and rerunning, all 8 empty claims/branches cleaned, issues back to pending
- Verifying CLI git auth works end-to-end before restarting worker: Auth verified — pull+push both work. Restarting worker: worker restarted with fresh agent-id, claimed issue #16, waiting for PR result: 🎉 **PR #19 created** — full pipeline works now. Confirm auto-merge workflow picks it up

#### Tab2 continued — auto-merge runs failed

- PRs #14/#15 auto-merge runs failed — checking workflow logic and failed run's job steps: CI passes on same branches but Swarm Auto-Merge fails — get exact failing step: Ruff fails on PR branches
- PR actually changed and ruff error itself: `behind_by:2` and only marker files changed — but ruff only scans `scripts/tools/`, which we never touch. Pull actual run log: Found it — auto-merge gate runs `ruff check scripts/tools/`, and repo's own `tools/` has **29 pre-existing lint errors** (mostly in `tools/session_guard.py`: `datetime.UTC`, `SIM115` context managers). Local `make check` only lints `scripts/tests/`, so this never surfaced — but it blocks **every** swarm PR from auto-merging
- Main has fresh commits including security cleanup removing password from docs — good. Lint debt spread across `tools/autopilot/*`, `llm_adapter.py`, `llm_worker.py`, `secure_pat.py`, `session_guard.py` — 14 auto-fixable, 15 manual. This is blocker for every swarm PR, so fix properly: stop worker first (it would otherwise sweep edits into its own `git add -A` commits), fix, gate, push, then rerun stuck auto-merge runs
- Worker left trail of PRs #19–22 with commits — pipeline works plus more empty claims from fast loop. Plan: fix lint debt (unblocks auto-merge for whole swarm), gate, push to main, rerun stuck auto-merges, clean empty claims, restart worker. Starting with lint fixes: 16 auto-fixed, 15 manual, applying all 15 manual fixes now
- All edits applied, full gate — exact command auto-merge workflow runs, plus `make check`: Both gates green. Quick smoke tests, then commit and push: Lint fix on main `45150db5397bd01058c7f5f535c0e54f49eef54c`. Now rerun stuck auto-merge runs for PRs and clean remaining empty claims from worker run #2 — current state: All 12 claims/branches are ours (issues 5–16); PRs #19–22 carry real commits. Before rerunning failed auto-merge runs, checking whether PR merge refs include main fix (they auto-recompute against base): Merge refs stale (pre-fix) or pending — rerunning won't help. Pushing no-op commit to each PR branch to trigger fresh gate run (exactly "fix and push to same branch" flow workflow suggests): Fetch syntax issue — fetching all refs instead

#### Current situation after PDF

- **Orchestrator Tab1:** Monitor loop pid 4623 ✅ heartbeats, GitHub worker general pid 4692 ✅ polling 45s, queue correctly empty until new `swarm:pending` seeds — **both stopped now** (you said 5 agents all stopped)
- **Worker-Brain Tab2:** Clean workspace boot with PAT retrieved from `shesh-workspace`, GATE OK, 3.3 MB/305 files, worker live claiming issues, then PR failures 422, fixed git identity + credential helper, PR #19 created 🎉, auto-merge pipeline live, but then lint debt blocked every swarm PR, fixed lint debt `45150db5397bd01058c7f5f535c0e54f49eef54c`, reran auto-merges
- **Other 3 agents:** Not detailed in PDF excerpt but likely similar — started, stopped, not good look for autocomplete

### Why autocomplete stopped — root causes (honest)

1. **Placeholder `do_work()`** — marked file every claim and let auto-merge silently close TODOs without doing them. Now fixed to refuse without implementer and release claim back to `swarm:pending` (drops lock ref + work branch + labels + reason comment). Placeholder behind explicit `--simulate`

2. **Missing git identity in sandbox** — `git commit` fails silently with no `user.name`/`user.email`, branches push empty, PR 422 "No commits between main and branch". Fixed by setting repo-local git identity via `setup_worker.py`

3. **Missing git credential auth** — `claim_issue_atomic` creates branch via API, but CLI `git push` uses origin URL without PAT (has no credentials) and `|| true` swallows error, so remote branch stays empty. Fixed by credential helper reading decrypted PAT + setting remote URL with PAT for push

4. **Lint debt blocking every PR** — `tools/` had 29 pre-existing lint errors, local `make check` only lints `scripts/tests/`, so never surfaced, but `swarm-auto-merge.yml` runs `ruff check scripts/tools/` and fails — blocking every swarm PR from auto-merging. Fixed in `45150db5397bd01058c7f5f535c0e54f49eef54c` (16 auto-fixed, 15 manual)

5. **Session guard auto-deleted plain PAT at 60-min hop threshold while processes needed it** — re-decrypted via password. Don't run `--status` mid-session if you want PAT to survive; it triggers handoff cleanup. Fixed by making `session_guard.py` not delete PAT on `--status`, only on `--handoff`

6. **Background committers + manual branch work share one working tree** — rebase hit heartbeat commit mid-flight. Future manual work: pause monitor first or use separate clone

7. **Long-running swarm processes buffer stdout** — heartbeat files in `swarm/heartbeats/` are reliable liveness signal, not logs

8. **Queue fallback defect** — when no component-matching Issue exists, old code fell back to arbitrary pending and claimed blocked kernel task. Fixed to strict filter — wait instead of claiming blocked

### What we fixed in this session (from PDF outputs)

- Created branch first, then patching labels block needs exact match
- Both files patched, syntax check, gate, commit, rebase, push, PR #36 live, #37 merged `fb2fc03614c44b9320577f21b695e200d0c78a18` closes #31
- Verified live — fresh heartbeats from monitor and worker plus third from `worker-shesh-audit` — multi-agent swarm genuinely running
- Found weakest link `do_work()` placeholder and fixed
- PAT fingerprint removed from worker logs
- `ensure_label()` before issue creation → seeding can never 422 on missing labels
- `HAS_RUNNER` honestly reflects autopilot import
- Queue housekeeping: closed 11 duplicate issues #19–#30 from stale re-seed, commented + `swarm:duplicate` and #29 `swarm:invalid`
- Now running: Monitor loop pid 4623 ✅, GitHub worker general pid 4692 ✅ polling 45s
- Clean workspace boot: `cryptography` and `ruff` didn't survive snapshot, installing them, decrypting PAT, GATE OK, `setup_worker --role brain --clean` 3.3 MB/305 files vs 36 MB
- Worker live claiming issues, fixed git identity + credential auth, PR #19 created 🎉, auto-merge workflow picks it up, lint debt fixed `45150db5397bd01058c7f5f535c0e54f49eef54c`, reran auto-merge runs

### What remains to make autocomplete work for hours (clear base)

**You are traveling, phone only, 1 orchestrator tab open, plus GitHub Actions true hours unattended:**

- **Keep 1 orchestrator tab open on phone** — `python tools/swarm/orchestrator.py --monitor` — seeds Issues from TODO, heartbeats every 60s, re-queues stale >10 min. Tap Continue when appears (mobile throttles background after 30-60 sec). This is best possible with phone.

- **Don't rely on 4-5 sidebar workers on phone** — mobile OS will throttle background tabs, they will pause. That's why 5 agents all stopped — not good look for autocomplete, but expected on mobile.

- **Rely on GitHub Actions for true hours:**
  - `swarm-scheduled.yml` cron hourly janitor (true hours, uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` no PAT) — resolves locks, syncs docs, re-queues stale, pushes to main
  - `swarm-llm-worker.yml` every 2h picks pending Issue, calls free GitHub Models `gpt-4o-mini` via `GITHUB_TOKEN` (no money), generates patch, `make check`, pushes branch `swarm/issue-N/llm-worker`, opens PR, `swarm-auto-merge.yml` merges if green
  - Push branch `swarm/issue-N/agent-id` + let Action merge — true hours unattended, no Arena tab needed

- **If you want true LLM coding for hours with zero tabs:** Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret in repo Settings → Secrets and use `swarm-llm-worker.yml` already implemented free version — it already uses GitHub Models free via `GITHUB_TOKEN`, no OpenAI API key needed, no money.

- **New foolproof prompts** in `docs/FOOLPROOF_SWARM_PROMPTS.md` — fetch encrypted PAT from GitHub raw `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gaganjainse/shesh-workspace/main/secrets/github.pat.enc`, then auto-prompt for password via `ask_user` UI, decrypt to plain 600, never mention password in open docs (fixed 22 occurrences scrubbed).

- **Efficiency:** `tools/setup_worker.py --role mind --clean` selective shallow clone `--depth 1 --filter=blob:none` 36M→1.3M, file count 3000→300, session 60→120-180 min, free

**Next steps for clear base multi-agent:**

1. **Fix remaining lint debt** — already fixed `45150db5397bd01058c7f5f535c0e54f49eef54c`, but need to ensure `tools/autopilot/*`, `llm_adapter.py`, `llm_worker.py`, `secure_pat.py`, `session_guard.py` all ruff-clean on main (done in 45150db5397bd01058c7f5f535c0e54f49eef54c, verified `make check` only lints `scripts/tests/` so didn't catch, but auto-merge gate lints `scripts/tools/` — now fixed)

2. **Set repo-local git identity in setup_worker.py** — ensure every new clean workspace does `git config user.email "gagan.jain.se@gmail.com" && git config user.name "Gagan Jain"` automatically

3. **Set credential helper reading decrypted PAT** — `git config credential.helper "store --file ~/.git-credentials"` or set remote URL with PAT for push: `git remote set-url origin https://$PAT@github.com/...` — implemented in worker after fix

4. **Make `do_work()` refuse without implementer** — already fixed, placeholder behind `--simulate`

5. **Ensure PAT survives session** — don't run `session_guard.py --status` mid-session if you want PAT to survive; it triggers handoff cleanup that deletes plain PAT. Fixed to only delete on `--handoff`, not `--status`

6. **Use separate clones for manual work vs monitor** — background committers + manual branch work share one working tree — rebase hit heartbeat commit mid-flight. Future: pause monitor first or use separate clone `/tmp/ws2/shesh-ecosystem` for manual work

7. **Heartbeat files as liveness signal** — `swarm/heartbeats/` are reliable, not logs (long-running processes buffer stdout)

8. **Clear backlog** — shesh-brain, shesh-media, shesh-messaging implemented and pushed, manifest now 22 devel (18 canary), locks regen, exhaustive audit 54 repos

**Current state after fixes:**

- `docs/NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md` auto-generated with live metrics + PAT status `need_password=true` after handoff
- `make check` GATE OK 30 tests
- `swarm/` queue now has 14 open issues all `swarm:claimed`/`swarm:blocked` — shesh-kernel→SheshAOS Rust track correctly blocked (no cargo in sandbox)
- Monitor loop pid 4623 ✅, worker general pid 4692 ✅, plus worker-shesh-audit 8 completed — multi-agent swarm genuinely running, then all stopped (expected after 60 min hop threshold — session guard auto-deleted plain PAT)

**What to do now (you are traveling, phone-only, 1 chat open):**

- Keep 1 orchestrator tab open on phone: `cd /home/user/shesh-ecosystem && git pull && python tools/session_guard.py --status # will ask password via ask_user UI → give your encryption password (not mentioned in open docs) && python tools/setup_worker.py --role platform --clean && make check && SWARM_USE_GITHUB=1 python tools/swarm/orchestrator.py --seed TODO.md --dashboard && python tools/swarm/orchestrator.py --monitor`
- Enable GitHub Actions: https://github.com/gaganjainse/shesh-ecosystem/actions → `Swarm Scheduled Janitor` → Enable (runs hourly, true hours unattended while traveling)
- When back on laptop, open 5 tabs with foolproof prompts from `docs/FOOLPROOF_SWARM_PROMPTS.md` — each fetches enc PAT from GitHub raw, auto-prompts for password, selective clone, no 22 repos waste, atomic claim, branch per task, PR + auto-merge

This situation report is based on your PDF outputs from 5 agents that started all stopped — not good look for autocomplete, but we dogfooded and fixed weakest links through the system itself.
